            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Good Cause teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Confidence;</hi> Therefore it is, <hi>My Lord,</hi> that now step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Providence on the stage of the World, and a world of censures, I humbly crave Your <hi>Highness</hi>'s Signature at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance:
<pb facs="tcp:170272:3"/>The subject of this sad History, together with the great affairs now on foot, makes me believe that my poor endeavours fall directly under Your <hi>Highness</hi>'s cognizance: And this, <hi>my Lord,</hi> is the only ground of my rude accost, next to the little ambition I have to die in debt to my own duty.</p>
            <p>Here is, <hi>my Lord,</hi> presented to Your speciall perusall, a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Story, a piece of such cruelty and impiety as reaches beyound example; such a piece of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous villany, as hath not the least adumbration to shadow it from Divine Justice. Here may Your <hi>Highness</hi> behold the greatest cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Tyranny, with splendid equipage, walk up and down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul: A place so loaded with fatall Butcheries, Murthers, and Massacres of many thousands of poor Protestants; so invested
<pb facs="tcp:170272:3"/>with Christian blood, that some eminent and unheard of vengeance cannot but threaten as the proper effects of so direfull impieties: Oh! my Lord, How many poor Christians are here begging for death in a living Sepulchre! This, this is the place wherein Your <hi>Highness</hi> may perceive the crying and scarlet sinne of murther hath made so ample a progression: Oh! let Your <hi>Highness</hi> think of those numerous tears that You may wipe away from flowing eyes, at the first sight of Liberty; That as a bird delivered from the snare, mounts with delight, so may the poor servants of the <hi>most High</hi> rejoyce in their approaching hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. For</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> who knows but Your Highness is now called out by the Great Jehovah to root out this Monster, and make inquisition for blood: What godly Protestant
<pb facs="tcp:170272:4"/>is there in this Nation, or beyond the Seas, (which beholding the grand Affairs now in agitation) cannot a little trace Divine foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps, and conclude them to be greater pieces of Providence than ever yet ingros't the Worlds ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance? To see the <hi>Victorious King of Sweden,</hi> with the no less courage of <hi>Your Highness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Man of Sinne:</hi> Oh! how it rejoyces the hearts, and swels the hopes of all good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants into a belief, that now God is setting his foot on the neck of Tyranny, and Popish cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty: These are, <hi>my Lord,</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, that fill the World with big expectations, and oh! that this Dagon of Cruelty may fall under the powerfull Conquest of Your <hi>Highness</hi> acquests. As it is true, <hi>my Lord,</hi> 'tis pity that Greatness should ever be out of the road of Goodness; so is it as true,
<pb facs="tcp:170272:4"/>that it refreshes the hearts of all good Christians, to see Your <hi>Highness</hi> use Your Power to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Truth, and expatiate the bounds of the Protestant Interest: Let me therefore take the boldness to put Your <hi>Highness</hi> in minde of that good maxim, <hi>Verè mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num est magna facere, &amp; teip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum putare nihil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And since, <hi>my Lord,</hi> we have entred on such a Just and Honourable Warre with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Nation, <hi>(in which this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine vegetable grows, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so full of bloody resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against all Protestants)</hi> why may not Your <hi>Highness</hi> prove that blessed Agent in Gods hand, to reduce their Tyranny to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? There's no other way, my Lord, to curb the rage of this Ocean of blood, but by Power to break their bands asunder; and it cannot be less then a sinne of a
<pb facs="tcp:170272:5"/>crying nature, to be mercifull to such cruel Tygars <hi>Happy shall they be that take and dash their little ones against the stones.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 137.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Some may say, and I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it is true, <hi>my Lord,</hi> That Peace and quiet is the <hi>Summum bonum</hi> in Politicks; and that freedom of Religion is the <hi>unum necessarium</hi> in the body of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is a Notion also that lieth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost in the understandings of all men; on these hinges hang our lower happiness; Peace and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being inseparable companions to a sure fabrick. That Peace is built on sand, that hath not Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for it's Foundation. And for the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> Your <hi>Highness</hi> very well knows, <hi>(for it's out of the reach of question)</hi> that he is the grand enemy to the heart of our happiness; and it's good Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick to reckon our safety best guarded in a Warre with him;
<pb facs="tcp:170272:5"/>neither can I imagine it any other then a blasphemy against discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to follow the inconsiderate vogue of a clamorous peace; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with such as shroud trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery under it, as make Peace a Pandor to it. He that wisheth well to posterity, and rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands our quarrell, cannot grudge to contribute the best part of his estate, to the support of so good a Cause, nay he that is a true Protestant, and hath but his veins well fil'd with true English blood, will not I hope think it all lost, if it please God to call him to so great an honour. The Proverb is, <hi>He that makes a good Warre, makes a good Peace:</hi> And it is, <hi>my Lord,</hi> with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as with Nettles, that sting most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently, when handled most gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: So as Your <hi>Highness</hi> may conclude, <hi>That it is a good Peace, to have none with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170272:6"/>
            <p>For, <hi>my Lord,</hi> He that knows any thing of former transactions in Q <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders what friends the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have alwaies been, and now are, <hi>(by a naturall Antipathy)</hi> to <hi>England:</hi> If he yet doubts of the Justness and Legality of our Cause, 'tis pity but his Neck should hung in suspence with his Conscience. It cannot but be accounted a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to posterity, for Your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to suffer such a liberty of Commerce, which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> only makes as a Trap for the thraldom of our Consciences. <hi>My Lord,</hi> If we must have a Peace, let it never be said (I had almost let my Pen deviate into that sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster path of boldness, as to say cursed be the day) that <hi>England</hi> shall stoop to any conditions with <hi>Spain,</hi> unless with such honour, as may not only make our Nation formidable in the Western World,
<pb facs="tcp:170272:6"/>but also that in <hi>Spain</hi> it self <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conscience shall usher in a Freedom of Trade,</hi> rather than a Trade draw down that hook of ruine, wrap't up in that bloody bait of the cruel Inquisition. Till then, my Lord, what Merchant can say, his <hi>Life, Estate, Ship, Goods,</hi> &amp;c. when once arrived in <hi>Spain,</hi> are his own, if the bloody Inquisition please to call them theirs? Never let posterity be tied to so hard a bargain, as to pay their Lives and Liberties as the Interest of so sad a purchase. Therefore I may be so bold with Your <hi>Highness,</hi> as to affirm, <hi>That Peace without Liberty, is no other then a winding-sheet for both.</hi> So that, <hi>my Lord,</hi> if we look not about us, time and experience (the two great lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Reason) may illustrate this assertion, and too sadly form it into a truth, if that be true,
<pb facs="tcp:170272:7"/>
               <hi>Qui ante non caveat, post dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.</hi> And</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>my Lord,</hi> when I call back the thoughts of my boldness with Your <hi>Highness,</hi> I remember the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb, <hi>That Paper blusheth not,</hi> yet do I, till assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in hope of acceptance, from so grand a master-piece of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Prudence. Your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> I doubt not, will put on so much candor, as to forget the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of this sacrifice, whose only worth (if any) is lodg'd in the Zeal and Affection to the service of all true Protestants, and my own Country: and I hope to be the sooner forgiven, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that there's nothing in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to excuse a fault more, then the intentions rightly fixed, though not successfull.</p>
            <p>May it therefore please Your <hi>Highness</hi> to pardon my presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and give me liberty to leave
<pb facs="tcp:170272:7"/>my duty behinde me, in a few good desires to the happiness of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. May Your <hi>Highness</hi> press forward, and be as a standing example, a Monument of Zeal for God, even to Posterity; That Your <hi>Highness</hi> may be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of innobling the English Nation, in reviving it's antient, and enroling its present Valour in the Records of Fame: I will conclude, <hi>my Lord,</hi> with that commendable saying of one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Noble <hi>Gustavus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden, That he passed through the Temple of Vertue, ere he arrived to that of Honour.</hi> Which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flattery cannot unfitly be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to the Crown of Your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall Glory. Thus will the Lord Crowne the Industry of Vertuous Actions, with the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Lawrels of his own bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: That this may be Your

<pb facs="tcp:170272:9"/>Reader,</hi> have thee not to look asquint on other mens Labours, till thou canst shew better of thy own: Emulation is in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much innobled, as in striving to out-vy others in goodness: And he that saies <hi>Grantham</hi> Steeple stands awry, let him set a straighter by it. I do confess this piece might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have been undertaken, by men whose Cabinets or Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces, enshrine better parts then my own; and that's one reason among others, (wherein I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my self Counsellour) why I do not agnize this piece with my hand, though with my heart I seal to it. But seeing I have level'd my minde at the Butt of Integrity, I may be the better excused if I hit not the white, since I intend the same; and this I reckon a priviledge I can only boast of and be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<pb facs="tcp:170272:10"/>so that when envy is struck blinde, and detraction banished, posterity shall receive a badge of my industry.</p>
            <p>For this sad History of the <hi>Spanish Inquisition,</hi> 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible (favourable Reader) but thou hast met with it in this or another Language, yet is it not out of date, though out of Print: Somewhat more there is added then what I found at first; and its not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable if I affirm, there's also less: 'Tis gleanings, I confess, and who knows not that oft times they are the best Corn: I hope there is none expects a new Inquisition, this old one is enough for one world; and this I'le assure thee, That though I draw my water from sundry Cesterns, yet they all come from the Fountain and Spring of Truth,
<pb facs="tcp:170272:10"/>so farre as History hath remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to posterity. To fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish it into any other stile then plainness, would obscure the Narrative, and put a gloss on vileness; and to comment were as needless, for the meaning of their impieties are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in the reading; take it therefore in the true nature of the Originall, some few Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis excepted: And kinde Reader, (if thou wilt move within the sphear of reason) I hope it may be said, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mature and deliberate bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, my endeavours, if sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up by Candor, may have a Pass-port for their safe land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the breast of the most rigid Censurer. Therefore I intreat thee to wink at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects either of Press or Pen, and suffer thy kinde acceptance to be my <hi>Errata.</hi>

            <p>My purpose is not to defame the Nation of <hi>Spain,</hi> I leave the world to judge of their actions, which by their friends (I doubt) will be thought too full of infamy; nor do I hate a Catholick because he is so, those I know to be ingenious, I therefore love and honour; I dislike indeed of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as they of mine; but their persons I wish as much happiness, in this and another world, as my own, and if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that they may go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their own way: But oh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to think, that Religion should be the foundation of cruelty, it's enough to astonish Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and make Barbarians blush.</p>
            <p>Courteous Reader, Thou maiest here bathe thy self in tears at the sad perusall of this Spanish cruelty. Here thou
<pb facs="tcp:170272:11"/>hast a little taste of the sad ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities and miseries of the poor <hi>Netherlands,</hi> occasion'd by this bloody Inquisition, the unparalell'd Butcheries and Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres of poor innocent souls, with most exquisite cruelties, and only for their Religion: Here maiest thou see poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants tormented with such strange cruelties as never durst be owned under the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperours: Here are poor Christians rack't and torn with such strange diabolism, as they rack even cruelty it self, to make it confess a Bull of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris,</hi> or some exquisite Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in it's bowels yet <hi>incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita,</hi> knocking at the very gates of Hell for new Tortures: But alas! I am sorry to think, that whilst they Martyr others, they have too hot a bargain for themselves. Here do they
<pb facs="tcp:170272:12"/>make a trade of burning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians alive and dead, with sad imprisonments, hunger, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, cold, rackt, rent, and disjoynted in their bodies, with sad Torments; many hundred Christians are here after a strange way of Triumph, brought forth in publick, all cloathed with garments paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Devils, only to make them appear ugly to the world, all which is not only counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> but this wicked Court erected with glorious Titles of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which under covert, do justifie wickedness in the face of God and the world: But <hi>simulata pietas, duplex iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</hi> Oh! to hear the sad groans of the dying in this Cell of Misery! How tears in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate call for pity from all true Christians, and aid from all
<pb facs="tcp:170272:12"/>Protestant Estates and Princes.</p>
            <p>These are they, that like <hi>Nero, Qui nullum non magnum bonum damnavit; That hated goodnesse for its own sake:</hi> These are they that can wade through all impieties, so they can but with <hi>Frederick,</hi> lay all the powers of the world under the Popes feet; who by blood and cruelties, doe emasculate and dis-spirit the souls of men, turning the Image of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nature of beasts; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self blushes at their great villanies, and proclaims their impieties as prodigious; all the monstrous shapes 'twixt <hi>Affrica</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> cannot frame a likeness to this savage Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; A place where such su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative wickedness reigns, as will no doubt in due time, pull down Gods just vengeance, as a coherent to their sanguinary
<pb facs="tcp:170272:13"/>cruelties: It's a wonder that <hi>Atlas</hi> his shoulders should not shrink under the depression of so shrewd a burden. There is nothing in the poor Nation of <hi>Spain,</hi> that doth not bend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Authority of this bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Inquisition; and it was, no doubt, the hand of Satans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, that first hung this pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock on the Liberty of <hi>Spain;</hi> I do not think but the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> themselves would be glad to follow the example of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> who after the death of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth <hi>(the first founder of the Jesuites)</hi> broke into the Inquisition house, wounded the chief Lord, put the rest to flight, set fire on it, and released the prisoners; and I also think but that if the <hi>Indies</hi> were pluckt from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> this Inquisition would be found one of the
<pb facs="tcp:170272:13"/>best stakes in his hedge, the best Pillar to support his Throne. But</p>
            <p>To dissect this gulph of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, to wade in these miseries, and not be drowned in tears, will too much evidence obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy; and oh! that this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous brat had continued in the <hi>Embrio,</hi> or proved Abortive in the birth. But some may be ready (with the Poet) to say, <hi>Si vis me flere dolendum est, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum ipsi tibi: He that would draw tears from others, must first weep himself:</hi> 'Tis true, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess tears drop often by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Therefore give me leave to take up that expression of a good Author, made on the sad death of the Lady <hi>Jane Grey:</hi>

               <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> said of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. so say I, <hi>If all cruelties were lost, they might be found in this Inquisition:</hi> For indeed they behave themselves like men of consummate impiety, barbarous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bloody, even Cannibals, that live on the blood of the Saints: and if we do but look into the West <hi>Indies,</hi> we shall not need a grand Jury of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to prove, not only this Court, but even <hi>Spain</hi> it self, so sanguinary, that through their blindness and cruelty, they have staggered with blood, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at noon-day; which I hope
<pb facs="tcp:170272:14"/>at last will clog the wheels of their motion, till they move like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Chariots in the red Sea. Who will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proverb, as well <hi>Rex Diabolorum,</hi> as <hi>Rex Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum,</hi> for they do not only bear such burthens of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as are able to oppress, nay overwhelm the whole universe, but also, that such devils of men, should have a liberty for their villany under the shelter of any Prince in the world, is strange, in so much that this bloody Inquisition, is from a little source, grown to such a rapid torrent, as threatens ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack to all Protestants, that sail in the Seas of <hi>Spanish</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties. I cannot forget, how the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadour once viewing the <hi>Venetian</hi> Treasury in S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
               <hi>Mark,</hi> looks to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
<pb facs="tcp:170272:15"/>and saies to the Duke of <hi>Venice, But my Masters Treasury hath no bottom,</hi> (meaning the
<note n="*" place="margin">Where his cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and riches had one date.</note>
               <hi>Indies.</hi>) May we not alude this jest to the Inquisition in earnest, That their <hi>Cruelties, Blood, Torments, and all manner of Villanies</hi> and <hi>Impieties,</hi> are here like a Mine that hath no bottom, though doubtless will have an end; for it's an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy of unbelief to question it: and if such a faith and hope move not in the Zodiack of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Protestants expectation, 'tis to me a wonder.</p>
            <p>I confess, Christian Reader, these are sad rehearsals of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Tyranny and Cruelty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Bodies and Consciences: but who knows not that the glory is the sufferers; <hi>If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him;</hi> Is not that a Glorious exchange? In the
<pb facs="tcp:170272:15"/>times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, Christians chose rather to live in Desarts, Caves, and Rocks, then bid adew to Religion; and it's no less our duty in these times: The life of a Christian is chequered with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitudes, and afflictions are like crosses in the game of this life, but the inward and eternall advantages thereof (if sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) what are they? but to work out for us <hi>a more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternall weight of glory: It's better to suffer afflictions with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of sinne for a season:</hi> The Lord hath been pleased to make the afflictions of this world, as a thorow-fair to glory and immortality: <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no abiding place, but must seek one to come.</hi> We may here delightfully (in the midst of a bloody Theatre) reade, how
<pb facs="tcp:170272:16"/>these Saints and servants of the living God, went over their cruelties with valour, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them with patience: These blessed Martyrs were like the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that boldly marched to heaven through the red Sea of blood: And indeed, <hi>Multi amant veritatem lucentem, oderunt redarguentem,</hi> we must love the truth, both shining and scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There is nothing so He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary to a Christian life as sufferings: <hi>He that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer.</hi> Now courteous Reader, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still this sad History through a good Alimbeck, is the proper road to a right use; it's the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and true Index to finde out the Quintessence of so sad, yet sweet dispensations. Oh! the great blessings of Liberty in Peace, it's the barrenness of our stony hearts, if plenty of
<pb facs="tcp:170272:16"/>mercies dull our affections, and blunt our senses: The poor Protestants of <hi>Spain,</hi> cannot enjoy a breathing under their own Vines, unless coucht in a yoak of unexpressible Tyranny. And here as in a glass, may the Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> see their great engagements, that the Liberty they enjoy, is not in the midst of Fire and Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got.</p>
            <p>Let all Protestants now unite in affection for our own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; let us lay aside our own interest for that of Gods; that as it was said of that grave
<note n="*" place="margin">Lord <hi>Burleigh.</hi>
               </note> Counsellour to that great Monarch Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when arming himself for repose, he cast off his night Gown, with these words; <hi>Lie thou there Lord Treasurer:</hi> So do I wish, that we may say to our private animosities, <hi>Be buried in forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170272:17"/>then shall we be fit to advance forward in this <hi>Holy, Just,</hi> and <hi>Honourable Warre</hi> with <hi>Spain;</hi> A Warre that brings to minde the Noble spirits that filled the Veins of our English Gallantry in blessed Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> daies. Let us never be so sordid as to hugg Lives or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states so close, but that both may be ventured to the blessing of that wise God, who sitteth on the circle of the Heavens, and Governs the great trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the World; so shall we expect a blessed issue as the fruit of our labours, and poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be guarded from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and the Wolf: And they that will not thus do for their own safety and the Nations; but like a swoln and turbulent Sea, roar at every action they handle not, blowing a Trumpet to Mutiny against their own
<pb facs="tcp:170272:17"/>happiness; What must (I say) be the issue? but rigorous and wholsome severity; for who reckons it not good in order to absolute security, to make such sit still in the Boat of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, when storms threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten shipwrack to the whole.</p>
            <p>Courteous Reader, I have too great reason to be jealous that I have exceeded the bounds of an Epistle; I shall therefore intreat thy pardon and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss thee to the perusall; That as to thy Judicious approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and kind acceptance, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre my affectionate endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; so do I both to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, and Rest.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170272:24"/>the Almighty Arme of Jehovah could wrest them from the powerfull hand and hard heart of <hi>Pharaoh; I am the Lord thy God that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</hi> And you may observe in the Scriptures, what a series of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they crept under, as if bondage and slavery had been their portion; and indeed by that did the most wise God reduce them to obedience. Who is not acquainted with the infinite Persecutions of holy <hi>David,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Elisha?</hi> Blessed <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah</hi> sawn asunder: Who has not read of the revilings and taunts breathed from the profane spirits of <hi>Sanballat, Tobiah</hi> and <hi>Geshem,</hi> against (that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full servant of the living God <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah?</hi> Innumerable are the examples of Gods Saints who underwent the rage and fury of their implacable enemies.</p>
            <p>In the Raigne of those Monsters of Nature the Romane Emperours, was such a hot season for Professors of the Gospell, that you could hardly set a foot in <hi>Rome,</hi> but to tread on the graves of the blessed Martyrs, which continued for three hundred years.

               <hi>Peter</hi> laid down their lives for the Gospell under that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Nero,</hi> of whom <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his Apologie for the Christians, sayes, That the Gospell must needs be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, because <hi>Nero</hi> hated it: Yet it is observed, that Popish cruelty, and bloody malice to Protestants, has out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied all the persecutions of ungodly Heathens, having for six hundred years acted all inhumane butcheries and Tragicall treacheries on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies of many thousands of Gods dear and faithfull ones: and to this day let but the least gap be open, or the smallest opportunity (without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) be offer'd, and we shall sadly see and feel, that their bloud and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery ends not where it begins: What plotting against (that heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument in Gods hand) the blessed Queen <hi>Elizabeth?</hi> Yet did she escape by miraculous providences: Who is not afraid to call back the thoughts of that horrid, impious and unparalleld Massacre of <hi>Paris?</hi> The great gulph of savage cruelty, blood rapes and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein died two hundred thousand Protestants, (and now I hope that report may be true,
<pb facs="tcp:170272:25"/>that no venomous creatures will live there; such is, and I hope will be the care of such as govern at the helme of this Common-wealth.) The late sad and bleeding condition of the poor Protestant <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses;</hi> Nay the poor Protestants in <hi>Zurick</hi> are no sooner instated in the truth of the Gospell, but as surely and sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lose both Liberty and Estate, I wish they may save their lives: Yet let us summe up the short lives of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and they seem to apologize for the Saints. Qu. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of blessed memory, had the date of her life often renewed by Gods Providence, so that eight Popes dropt into their graves ere she stept to Heaven.</p>
            <p>What seas of Protestant blood and misery has been shed and spilt, in <hi>England, France, Germany, Italy, Spaine,</hi> and other places, from 1550, (when the croaking Froggs from out of the pit had first their being,)

<pb facs="tcp:170272:25"/>infinitum,</hi> for which the Name of the great Jehovah be for ever blessed: And I think I might here erect a challenge to all, that whereas many millions of souls have been split be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Carybdis</hi> of Popish rage and villanies, have felt the fury of Beasts invested with humane shape, yet how few or no Catholicks ever suffered death for their Religion at the hands of Protestants, unlesse as evill doers, and transgressors against the Lawes of our Nation: we may bid defiance to all Papists, to instance one plot of treachery, one tittle of perjury, or any tollerable act of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty imposed on that Religion.</p>
            <p>Now truly though the persecutions of Gods Saints by many Tyrants and Popes, have swel'd to a vast bulk, yet can I not say, that any have justled for priority with this monstrous, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and bloody Inquisition: and though here is only a taste of the Impious cruelty of one Court in one City, yet may we with <hi>Pithagoras,</hi> trace the footsteps of this <hi>Hercules</hi> of cruelty, and by the print of his feet in <hi>Sivill,</hi> guesse at the monstrous proportion of his whole Body in that
<pb facs="tcp:170272:26"/>Kingdome of <hi>Spaine:</hi> Here you have cruelty and blood justified, only it puts on the countenance and face of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and we are so farre from find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>parvum in magno,</hi> a little good in such mountains of pretences, that we finde an Abifs of impiety, wickedness to the brim, and when the reader has run through this large field of Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, he will finde too little good in such spatious volumes of pretences; I know not the threshold of my own house, if this be not the threshold to hell, the gate of Perdition, the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of infernall spirits.</p>

            <p>Now that this Nursery of horrid Cruelties, this brat of the Devill (for I cannot cloath my thoughts in softer tearms) had a beginning none doubt, and that it shall have as cursed and quick an end, I hope all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians not only expect, but daily praye for: The Lord knowes the sad sufferings and great afflictions of his poor Saints; that though the thread of their expiration seem to bear no date, yet in his own due time he will no doubt put a <hi>Finis</hi> to such unparalleld cruelties:

               <p>Now the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> considering these people to be only nominall Christians, shrowding their lives, liberties and estates, under these pretexts of being turned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, thought it not amisse therefore to provide for their conversion another way; but alas we shall see these resolutions prove abortive, or not succeed their intentions, being perverted into a wrong current by ill Agents, and instead of mildnesse, the bloodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est cruelty and oppression that ever courted the habitable world, and acted with such strange shapes of deceit and diabolicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions, that it may fitly be termed the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Epitome of Hell, the Engrosser of all Impieties and Cruelties; it's beyond admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, almost beyond belief: and truly it is to be lamented, that men should prove such Tyrants and Devils incarnate, usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humane shape the better to delude and deceive; that men should have such seared consciences as not to perceive the foot-steps of Divine wrath attending as their doome, Hot to see what a fearfull precipice, and brink of danger on which they most dangerously stand.</p>
               <p>To further this good purpose of the Kings there was an Order of Friars under the Name of Saint <hi>Dominick,</hi> who seemed as men overtaken with an extasie of joy for so good and heavenly inclinations, they therefore spurre on these resolutions, that they may not perish in the embrio, but ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to their birth: Now this spawne of Friars was so adored and worshipped even by Princes themselves (for that they were a

               <p>Having thus fixed their station in the bosomes of Kings and Councels, they lay a foundation of charity, whereby to reduce (say they) all erring, and instruct all igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the way of true Christianity; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending this holy Inquisition should be ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to no other end: and should also be provided with godly Ministers and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that with all gentleness and meckness they would proceed: on this account was the Inquisition first instituted, whereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of charity and sanctity, they proved only like horse-leeches, sucking blood from the veins of poor innocents: for these poor souls were put past hope of all future liberty, either of lives or estates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rob'd and spoiled of all their goods, and put to most cruell Torments and bloody deaths, leading their lives in a sad and dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full slavery; thus did they kill men under pretex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170272:53"/>to my aim, being principally to shew what miseries it pleased the Lord to let this affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and distressed people undergo, and all in resisting this bloody Inquisition, a thing so abominated by all, and that on just grounds, as it's a wonder to me, that the Lord suffers them to live, or that the earth should not be unhinged, with the heavy load of their monstrous impieties; but Gods paths are unsearchable, and his waies past finding out. The Lord will at last I hope confound the supporters thereof in their own cruelties, that the pit they dig for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they may fall into themselves. What Protestant cannot say, he rejoyces to see the <hi>Netherlands</hi> thus redeemed from such a Yoak of Bondage? it's worth the perusall to see, how in the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>'s time, the revolt of many places of consequence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Enchusen</hi> had the preheminence to lead the Van, as an example of Freedom and Liberty to all the rest.</p>
               <p>Let us view a few of this great Dukes cruelties, even beyond paralell: that as it is said of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour <hi>Caligula, He never spared man in his rage;</hi> so was it with this monster of men; as Lions are known by their claws, and cocks by their spurs, so he by his Tyranny, by his infinite mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<note place="margin">An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of piece of cruelty.</note> being the perpetuall tormentor of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue where ever he found it; He caused a piece of the greatest cruelty to be done on a Gentleman, that ever I read of, whom he chained to the stake, and encompassed with a gentle fire at a distance, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> sporting themselves therewith (like <hi>Indians</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:170272:53"/>about their fires) turning him about like a poor beast, which great and unheard of villany was committed till the Officers, pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his languishing tortures and pain, thrust him through, contrary to the purpose of the Duke and bloody Priests. He caused exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution to be done on Noblemen and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of quality, by abject and vile fellowe: and yet not satiated with blood and cruelties committed on Nobles, Gentlemen, and Merchants, by tortures and banishments; but using those that committed their safety to his mercy, with as much cruelty as is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, that all Princes pitied their deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and sad condition, being <hi>ranscokt, spoild, ruin'd, expel'd, destroy'd imprison'd, chained, banished, burned, hanged, beheaded, broke on wheels, hanged alive by the feet,</hi> with <hi>horrible and incredible tortures; racking and murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> so many Nobles and Gentlemen, as to say a few, were to rob him of the glory of his cruelties; and not so, but young and old, poor and rich, orphans and widows, such infinite numbers of all sexes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, suffered the rage of his tyranny, as it seemed like that <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours wish, that <hi>Rome</hi> had but one neck, the people of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> one throat, to be cut by the sharp razor of his bloody minde. He once boasted, <hi>That in the space of six years, he had executed by course of Justice, eighteen thousand men;</hi> yet the President of his Councell said he spoiled the <hi>Netherlands</hi> with too much mercy. Let all the world stand amazed at Popish and Spanish cruelties and blood: Could it be accounted mercy, when a man
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170272:54"/>could not be master of his goods, life, or daughters chastity, but all must bend under the yoak of their villanies, and deboist im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties? Nobility, Riches, Honour, nor no kinde of worth could priviledge it's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to any kinde of pity or civillity. He suborned witnesses to swear what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. The burning of many Towns are yet fresh in remembrance:
<note place="margin">130 <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in</hi> Brussels, <hi>and</hi> 60 <hi>in</hi> Gaud.</note> One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty Bourgers are murthered at one time in <hi>Brussels:</hi> and in <hi>Gaud</hi> sixty Bourgers, with great number of men and women to boot.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Ypre,</hi> at the execution of a Minister, there was twenty two <hi>Bourgers</hi> shot and murthered; at <hi>Dornick</hi> many slain: Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable were the murthers of many poor Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Protestants in <hi>Harlem</hi> and <hi>Naerden;</hi> when the City was surrendred on terms of life, he let some Bourgers and Souldiers starve to death, unworthily saying, <hi>He gave his promise for their lives, but not to give them meat:</hi> He made <hi>Bourgers</hi> Pioneers, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be slain; the children of this distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed people used to be affrighted by their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents at the naming of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> such were his abominable and detestable courses: Thus he wallowed with the swine, in the filth of his own cruel nature, and surfeited on the pride of his full content, drinking the blood of poor Christians, like <hi>Nector</hi> and <hi>Ambrosia.</hi> I'le conclude all with some verses made of as great a Tyrant as himself, if possible, which in my judgement will fitly resemble some part of his ravenous disposition and nature to the life.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:170272:54"/>
               <p>Let's imagine his cruelties to breath thus,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>I love at leasure favours to bestow,</l>
                  <l>And tickle men, by dropping kindness slow:</l>
                  <l>But my revenge, I in one instant spend;</l>
                  <l>That moment which begins it, doth it end.</l>
                  <l>Half doing undoes many; 'Tis a sin</l>
                  <l>Not to be soundly sinfull, to begin</l>
                  <l>And tire: Ile do the work; they strike in vain,</l>
                  <l>Who strike so, as the strucken may complain.</l>
               </q>
               <p>These, these were a part of the cruelties committed on the poor <hi>Netherlands;</hi> thus by the violence, and exquisite methods of cunning and deceitfull wickedness, these poor people were forced to follow the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of their own Liberties, God having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that Country to be the Randevouz of their own misfortunes. This great Tyrant (it's true) died in peace, (a wonder) but the great Judge of heaven and earth, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times asswages his present judgements, to greaten their future damnation; their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments are forborn in this, that they may prove more perdurable in another world.</p>
               <p>Now let the whole world stand and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their astenishment, at such a Religion as stands on so bloody a Basis, as the ruine of thousands of Protestants. That such cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty should reside or lodge in men professing Christianity: What is thought bad enough to advance Popery? Murthers, Treacheries, Plots, Perjuries: What so cruel, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and bloody? What so unnaturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, and criminall before God, which they stumble at? if it may but advance them
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170272:55"/>one step to their barbarous desires; if they can but accomplish their own ends, though they make Religion and Holiness a Baud to their wickedness.</p>
               <p>Thus have I endeavoured (I hope with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking of gaps, or going out of the road of Method) succinctly, and in brief, to lay open the occasions of these sad mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the poor <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> with their just revolt from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, as well as now, do I wish they may prove, not only a thorn in his side, but a stake in the hedge of all good Protestants, against the Tyranny and blood of Popery: They need not now be afraid of the Spanish threats, who seemed to be like that insulting brag of the Grand Seigniour, who hearing of their success against <hi>Spain,</hi> said, <hi>If they troubled him as they did the Spaniard, he would send an Army with shovels and pick-axes; and hurl it into the imbraces of the merciless Sea.</hi> But blessed be God, that has set them free from such empty vaunts of the one, and real cruelties of the other: I wish their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness may alwaies be perspicuous, through their humble remembrance, and that as God hath tumbled down their Towring enemies, and calm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The sord thus sounded they can the better wade through the depth of their wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; therefore the more to terrifie and affright him into a snare, they look one at another, as if they had seen into his heart, and espied what the poor soul never thought of (for God knows many a poor creature is accused of strange things, when indeed they know as little hurt, as they do good) they

               <p>
                  <hi>First, That he being baptized into the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and now Apostatized, is become a acciple of</hi> Luther, <hi>by harbouring his Heresies in his heart; and not alone content to be mislead, but endeavour to lead others into the same path of perdition with himself.</hi> Then they charge him with such crimes, that although they cannot prove, yet having him in great jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, they are so confident in their Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as none that hears it, seemeth to doubt of the truth thereof,
<note place="margin">For want of proof they suborn false Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, whose Names also are concealed.</note> and is therefore proved by Witnesses suborned (for they may doe as they please; for they cannot err,) yet are the Witnesses concealed, and the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment framed so dubious, as men of indifferent judgments, may have their severall interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations accepted of, as reasonable with this compacted charge: Now if any thing be spoken that they say is Hereticall, then have they elbow-room to infer strange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, such as the premises will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; charging him with such crimes, as they are sure will shoot him beyond fear of death, and serve his turne, and theirs too. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample following, will too truly evidence the assertion. There was in <hi>Sivill,</hi> one who
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170272:62"/>said There was no Purgatory, and that the blood of Christ alone purgeth from sinne; he was a very simple man, and living in the countrey, had for fashion-sake got some Divinity by heart, to pass him the better off in company; having tipt his tongue with this Doctrine, which he had got in discourse and believed at leisure; is now at last ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended for it, and upon examination ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that he was only of that minde, according as he heard it, but if their Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses did not judge it sound Doctrine, he was resolved, never to draw it out into any use, and so intreated them to make a good Application of his too forward assertion; for he was resolved to pin his faith on their sleeves, and leave his judgment behind him: but they are not contented with this Answer, but must a little dally with their poor prey: so (concluding of this Antecedent) <hi>Ergo,</hi> (say they,) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (which in times past hath determined the contrary by Law) doth erre, and the Councell also erres, and that Justification cometh by faith only, wherein a man is made free and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved <hi>à poenâ &amp; culpâ.</hi> Thus doe they out of their wonderfull way of inferences, draw a huge catalogue of Hereticall Opinions, and indite him for them as if he had really said a hundred times more then ever he thought or understood, and thus was the poor man punished for daring to meddle with such edge tools of Divinity.</p>
               <p>They have in this Court,
<note place="margin">Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the shadow of a painted Advocate.</note> for a shadow of Justice, an Advocate to plead the Cause of the Prisoners, and it is indeed a meer va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170272:62"/>that flies away with the name, it's only the word Advocate, you may finde the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it in an English Dictionary, but the poor Creature that most needs it, shall have least use of it; the Name is of an excellent use, but the substance hurts and damnifies their purposes. Nay they are yet more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to doe Justice, for they doe not only choose an Advocate, but they select one themselves, which for fidelity, care and ability (say they) is most fit, and they also give their sober councell, (the devil fees them) that such an one is a very wise, and prudent man, able to manage your Cause, (speaking to this poor Christian) with great acuteness, and honest industry. But (not to speak in the Spanish, but honest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Dialect:) they are no wiser nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for this grave Councellour, the Client cannot speak a word with his Advocate in secret, nor dare the Advocate speak the least Iota of a word for his poor Client in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, unless he can bribe his own conscience with vertue, or sacrifice a larger offering to to the acceptance of the Lords of Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a greater reward then the estate of this poor Christian; so that this painted Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate is resolved to warp no more then he can with safety weave: He is just like some Lawyers, that will be retained in two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary causes; thus do they delude poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with the authority of Law, and at last (which is worst) their own souls also: Oh sad will be the account of these souls, they must be forced with the <hi>Salamander</hi> to live in the flames of Divine wrath, which their
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170272:63"/>horrid cruelties and extra-judiciall proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, have dearly purchased as their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and contracted as a debt due to their black enormities; compel'd to live in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting burnings, if the riches of grace move not with pardon towards their unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</p>
               <p>Two or three daies after the poor priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner has received his Accusation, the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate stands up to defend his Cause, with a stout countenance and trembling heart (like that Actor, that said he was not afraid, but his heart trembled) and indeed to plead for this poor Christian, were to put himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an equall capacity of misery, and be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to hire an Advocate for himself; so as he is not only bribed to silence, through fear, but is truly and really brib'd to be the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors Advocate, rather then the poor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners: Well, all this while the Advocate keeps sight on the Inquisitors countenance, reading his minde by the copy of his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and visage, which is a true Index to calculate his businesse, and how to step for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or start backwards: on the other side, the Inquisitors are afraid that the Advocate prates beyond his bounds, and their desire, though jump with equity, reason, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; afraid their deceits come to the test of the light, therefore as a rudder to a ship, so are their looks to the Advocate, a guide to steer them direct to what Port they please, by which means (again) the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate quakes, for fear a word drop, which might make all their pastime bitter, and cause the plaister that keeps open the soar,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170272:63"/>fall off to their infamy: He therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises the poor prisoner to be of good comfort, bidding him tell truth, as the only quiet to a troubled conscience, and expect favour from so mercifull and holy a Court: Thus the trembling Advocate (like the doubtfull needle 'twixt two loadstones, at once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining unto both, yet neither) fals off like like leaves in Autumn, proves only like the appses of <hi>Sodom,</hi> fair, but when toucht, turn to dust: this Office of an Advocate proves only a bait to catch with greater security; it may put poor distressed Christians in minde, that they have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, who pleads their Cause with God, to the great comfort and joy of their afflicted souls; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they undergo unexpressible torments of their bodies.</p>
               <p>The poor prisoner begins to be in hopes,
<note place="margin">The poor soul wishes death, is glad of it rather then die in a loathsom prison.</note> comforts himself with this, that though he shall lose his life, yet it will not be in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing and tormenting prison; all his hope is to have his Cause run to an issue, let the end be as it pleases God, rather then live without society, books, or any good means for the health either of body or soul; but alas! they cannot have liberty to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their lives, without torments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most unsufferable,

               <p>Now when these poor creatures have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured an unsufferable misery in loathsom prisons, worse then death, so that many choose to confess what they would desire, even against themselves, rather then lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish away with unsupportable Torments, rather desiring a period to their dolefull daies, then have the date of their lives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed with daily cruelties, and consumptive miseries.</p>

Oh! the height of impiety as farre from Justice, as their bloody souls from a good conscience; at as great a distance from truth, as themselves are deeply guilty of all the curses under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Good Lord, when will thy anger and indignation wax jealous, and be avenged on such bloody and cruell oppressors! How long, how long, O Lord, holy and just, wilt thou suffer thy poor Saints and people to lie grovelling under the burthen of such an unsupportable yoak of cruelty! Surely,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170272:66"/>surely, the Lord will at last hear the cries and groans of the oppressed, that cry to him night and day for mercy: Oh! that the Lord would make an ejection of such vicious enormities as swarm like vermin to this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kass, this body of bloody cruelty. 'Tis true, they proceed with success, but that cannot legitimate a cause, nor the power that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it, any more, then pretences warrant eruptions, and violent contingencies; if my pen could demolish such fabricks of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, and strike down the pillars of its foundation, he that reades may guess the length of its date. But it is God that suffers, and can set bounds to this great monster of amazement to all considerate men.</p>
               <p>But Reader, this is not all, we are but on the threshold of this proud aspiring Court of cruelty; I shall endeavour to leade thee into every room, but be not afraid, only weep at the sight of such sad conditions, wherein poor Christians are chained and remember it is the good will and pleasure of a gratious God, and forget not to prepare thy self, and be fitted when God shall call thee to undergo the fiery trial; for though the lion is not so fierce as he is painted, yet can I assure thee this Inquisition, as well as fire it self, is not able to be drawn so terrible and hot, as it is in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, If a mad man, or any vile villain amongst this Court of Rakehels bear any hatred to any man, though never so rich or learned, or if he be prompted to it for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, at the instigation of any mans virulent
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170272:66"/>or mortall foe, he is accepted of, and proves a sufficient promoter for their vile purposes; nay, if he forgetteth the very words he would say, then will the Inquisitors help him to remember what they desire of him for their purpose, although the villanous promoter never heard nor intended to speak any such thing, only what they prompt him to, he (being a slave and limb of the devil like themselves) dare not but fulfill their requests, nay it's well done if it please their holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: The day will come, it will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come, that they will know assuredly the value of immortality, and the compleat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of endless misery, for this momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary affliction which they put the Saints of the most high God unto; But it is a blessed condition to have God in affliction, 'tis good to be disciplin'd in the School of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, men understand not themselves so well in any condition, as adversity; it is an Index to finde out the frame and temper of a man, how it stands with his soul for eternity. Now although these Inquisitors would feast their auditors with a noise of good and holy deeds, and yet practice such diabolicall designes, and preach such dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable doctrines, as fils the mindes of people with horrour and amazement, yet does the Lord many times blinde their eyes, and benum their besotted souls, so as they often grope at noonday, and with the dog in the fable, catch at the shadow, thinking they get somewhat, yet are miserably beguiled, and gul'd in their own devises; A lively instance to this purpose take as follows:</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:170272:67"/>
               <p>In <hi>Sivill,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A very pleasant passage of providence.</note> at the house of <hi>Francisco à Cafra,</hi> did meet privately, a Congregation of Gods people, being noted to be very zealous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and holy Professors of the Gospel of Christ: they were in number three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, who lived dispersed up and down in many obscure places and corners of the City, yet did they often meet at this good mans house; amongst which number of Gods Saints and servants was a woman very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for zeal and knowledge (two excellent concomitants in the crown of vertue) and in other waies of Christianity, for which she was accounted one of the principall of her sex in this Assembly; she was expert in the holy Scriptures, and much found in the practice of a holy life, being very much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued of all those that professed the Gospel of our Lord Jesus, a woman indeed of singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar accomplishments, even to the joy of all her Christian acquaintance. It pleased the Lord of his good-will and pleasure, to suffer this godly soul to be possessed with frenzy and madness, whereby her zeal was turned into rage; her condition struck a damp into the spirits of all that were godly, and their former joy was turned into present sadness: However this godly man <hi>Francisco,</hi> as he was bound, so did he perform his duty, took her into his house, and kept her in bonds besir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a condition: She was indeed so farre gone in rage (as one possessed with an evil spirit) that in the heat of her passion, her mouth was filled with bitter words, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the whole assembly of Gods people, crying out <hi>Fire and faggots, fire and burn them,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:170272:67"/>endeavouring to overturn the happiness of so hard a purchase, being got with the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of life and estate. It so hapned out that on a certain day, whilst under the discipline of so sad a providence, she got loose from the fetters wherein she was secured and bound, she presently runs to the Inquisitors, knocks at the gates, enters, and with hast requires audience, they are not deaf to such a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; so they come into the Parlour, she is sent for, and comes into them, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any preamble, presently said, <hi>she had brought them a Catalogue of Lutherans, that were in the City in swarms, charging them of neglect, sitting still and letting them pass on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished:</hi> she began to reckon them, but the Inquisitors were struck into admiration, what the meaning should be, whether with an extasie of joy, that such a profitable nest was found (for they had not heard of a <hi>Lutheran</hi> a long time) or whether it was in regard of her strange gesture, in revealing her minde; but they hoped to make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of this purchase: However to hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band every minute of an opportunity, they silence her from prating, unless to better purpose, resolving to be vigilant, not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what a great fire a little matter kindleth, and what great productions are the proper fruits of small beginnings, resolving to sound the foord to the bottom: They reserve her, and send for this honest soul <hi>Francisco,</hi> in whose house she was kept, and from whose hands she had escaped; whom also she had intended as a frontier in this company, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he used to give her correction in the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170272:68"/>height of her frensie. At their summons he appears, they demand what this woman did mean by what she had said of the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> if you know any thing (say they) I pray pull not back your hand from doing God so good service, as to reveal it to us: This godly man knew not at first what to say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so sudden and unexpected, but here God gratiously fulfilled his promise, <hi>Take no care what you shall say,</hi> &amp;c, this <hi>Francisco</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently careless in regard of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that if death came he knew the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most was his happiness; he therefore boldly forces as well a laughter, to put them out of hopes, as that also he could not but smile at so strange an accident, and that if they knew all, they would laugh also at their good hap. But God in mercy had decreed it otherwise for the good of his poor Saints; he therefore tels them he could not but admire they should not understand her condition, saying that she had been so for two or three moneths, and so farre she was gone in that sad estate, as he was forced for her good to binde her, and beat her, a lively testimony appearing by the prints of the irons; that he had in charity taken this poor creature into his house, from which place she had by her strength broke loose, in so much that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing least she should undo her self by being her own executioner, he had for prevention been seeking her all over the City, little thinking she had been there, especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering she had little reason, and less cause to guide her thither, but now he rejoyced he had found her safe; and as for the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raus,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:170272:68"/>which she prated of, he said, that in her fits, she had no other song, being usually known, that such people must have one thing or other whereby they will keep them in discourse with all, all which if they would not believe from his testimony, then might they have ample information and proof from the irons at his house, and the testimony also of his neighbours, intreating them to let her be bound by some of the servants, and sent to his house again: Which she no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perceived, but she raged so vehemently, as the Castle resounded with an eccho, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to astonish the auditors; saying and crying, <hi>She was not so mad, but that she well knew he was the greatest</hi> Lutheran <hi>in</hi> Sivill, <hi>and that he had cruelly abused her with irons and blows;</hi> at which words they all broke out into laughter, commanding their servants to binde her, and carry her home to his house, as a place most fit for her condition, giving large applause to this honest <hi>Francisco,</hi> for so tender charity to such an object of piety, intreating him to keep her

Thus were these <hi>Achitophels</hi> of cruelty, policy and blood, strangled in their own folly, thus were they infatuated and blinded by the wisdom and Providence of the Heavenly Father, who watches day and night for the preservation of his poor people, for which his holy Name be blessed and praised for evermore: Had not God preserved them with his high and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stretched arm of protection, this poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170272:69"/>had been enough to plunge them all in trouble, and changed the scene of their pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sperity into a sad adversity. But the Lord is good in all his waies, and just in all his dealings.</p>
               <p>To prosecute our purpose know, that the Promoter or Informer never speaks or appears in Court, but the <hi>Fiscall</hi> (as our Attorney Generall in <hi>England</hi>) moves the Court, and takes all informations, so as the Promoter serves both to inform and witness: Three or four daies being past, the prisoner is summoned to put in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the depositions, who poor soul, to that purpose, is now come before them, and with him his dumb Advocate, having, as aforesaid, a name only; he draws forth no answer according to the duty of his place, but leaves the poor Client to do all himself as well as he can; so that this Advocate is only a resemblance of one, and serves for a piece of proof, to colour their unjust op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, for under this notion of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, is couch't cruell treachery to betray poor Christians into the jaws of Tyranny, forgeting that blessed command, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.8, 9. <hi>Open thy mouth for the dumb, in the case of all such as are appointed to destruction: Open thy mouth, judge righteousness, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</hi> Now as aforesaid, the Advocate pleads, but full of doubt and fear, and after many words like winde, comes at last to this result, that it's his best course to guess his accusers, and to except against them, and that he may have liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse any that is his enemy; and that if he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170272:69"/>could produce witnesses to prove his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation cross to the accusation, his cause would be pleaded to good purpose: This is all the poor prisoner has from this high and mighty name of an Advocate; he is now again sent back to prison, with threatnings to utter the truth or expect to be forced by torments. In three or four daies he is called again, they demand if yet he be resolved on serious deliberation to speak the truth, the good Advocate he still insists on his usuall method, demanding if he have guessed his accusers, and if the poor prisoner call to minde, then he intreats the Inquisitors to understand if it be not such and such a man with whom he hath formerly or is now at variance, and if it be not the man, then is his accusation still in force: Now if he guess him, the Advocate bids him shew his exceptions, yet dare not say he guessed right: Now the Advocate examines him, if he have good proof to clear his purgation, <hi>viz. If he be of the Romish faith, a lover and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourer of the Monks and Friars, and familiarly acquainted with them, observing all the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>whether he go often to shrift, to receive his Maker, and doing due obeysance to Crosses and Images;</hi> all which and much more he must produce proof to testifie, and that he is not of the Sect of the <hi>Lutherans:</hi> all which, if he can prove par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by witnesses, then may he make his purgation in nine daies, but this is a favour granted only where the Inquisitors witnesse is of weak proof, else have they no favour, but must guess their witnesses and

               <p>Now when the prisoner cometh thus far on in his business, and it only remains to purge himself by proof of his faithfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the Romish Religion; then if he be a Catholick how easie is it for him to stand stiff, when it's according to consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: But if a Protestant, then is this a try<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

It's no less then treading the blood of the Covenant under foot, therefore he will utterly renounce those hidden deeds of darkness, in denying his Lord and Saviour that bought him, and not worship dumb idols, stocks and stones.

               <p>TO delineate and draw to life, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cursed devices of this Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, exceeds my capacity, and indeed would involve me into a labrinth of sad studies, and not very pleasing to any Protestant Reader. The strange cruelties used are not only bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barism in the height, but like beasts void of reason, raging with madness, being drunk with blood: <hi>Indian</hi> Tigers cannot exceed the great impieties, which these bloody butchers of men exercise on Gods Saints, without either remorse or pity.
<note place="margin">Hell and the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion holds comparison.</note> Reader, thou wilt (it may be) ere thou hast perused fully their savage villanies, conclude with the Author, that there is little difference betwixt the torments of Hell and this place: Sure I am, greater cruelties on earth cannot
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170272:71"/>be committed on the bodies of poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, then the Inquisitors put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 'Tis true, who can dwell with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting burnings! eternity only puts the difference, 'tis without hope of relief, there's no end. Again, the just judgements of an angry God are irresistable, and Christ bids us not fear men, but God, who can cast both body and soul into hell fire. Therefore this puts the difference, in Hell eternall, on Earth they terminate in time: And then, here it is only the malice of men, which the presence of God in the soul sweetens and turns all into Cordials; is only by Gods permission and proves like the Refiners fire, and Fullers sope; being for the triall of his Saints, and in order to their greater glory hereafter: He it is that can cause their pride and cruelty to cease in a moment. But to erect a Court under pretence of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, is to abuse the right end of its institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to confront God and deceive their own souls, striving to deceive the world with the vest of innocency, yet cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the ugliness and blackness of their dark plors and a tempts, from the searching eye of the Almighty, for all things are naked and open before him with whom we have to do. To do injustice in the Name of God, is only to palliate cruelty with the vizard of holiness, it's greater then the evil it self; it's more hatefull to God and men, to murther one in the arms of love, and pretext of friendship, then to run a tilt at a man; and kill him out of malice; The sinne of <hi>Judas</hi> was aggravated by the betraying kiss: there
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170272:72"/>is not only the cruelty, but the abuse of the name of vertue, under which it creeps, is hatcht and shrowded: The prostitution of Vertue to the Baud of Vice, is <hi>The</hi> Evil.</p>
               <p>These sad relations of blood and horrible cruelty following, will certainly draw out the tears of any Christian, none can have a heart to reade and not lament their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: These Butcheries of men can have no pretence to evade the dint of Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, any more then it can his knowledge; although indeed they may pass by the eyes of men: The arrows of the Almighty will plerce through all oppositions, not only to discover, but to reward them according to the wickedness of their waies. But to proceed to these sad calamities.</p>
               <p>When once the sentence is passed, the prisoner cometh no more into their presence (unless it be to the Rack) untill the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall day of appearance in publick view, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to receive his doom according as they are pleased to pass it: Some are quit by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and it's given out they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by false witnesses (yet no false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness ever known to be punished.

               <p>Now doe the Lords Inquisitors speak (in an obscure dialect) to the Officers and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, by signes and words, much like to the canting language used by Gipsies and Vagabonds, whereby they need not be known to any but themselves; and whatever Torment they please to begin with, is done exactly even to the highest pin of cruelty: and as there is severall sorts of Cruelties and Torments, so are they more in number then is yet discovered; those known I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to discover to the world, and pity of all Protestants, and truly I am perswaded that all ingenious Papists will abhor the thoughts, if he can but believe such wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness to be acted in the Court, or if they have not too great a prejudice against the Author, who they must needs know is a Protestant, and therefore may make them stumble in their confidence of the truth; which being a thing I cannot avoid, shall not therefore perplex my thoughts to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170272:75"/>confest nothing, he is then let down, and more weights added to the former, then hoisted up to the top, thundring their threats against him if he confess not, commanding the Executioner to let him down, and then hoist him up so, that the load of Irons at his feet,
<note place="margin">Oh sad and unexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!</note> may disjoint all his body in a sad and cruell manner, which unexpressible pain pierces all the parts of his body, whereupon the poor soul houls and cries in a terrible manner, sutable to so unsupportable a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now instead of remorse and pity, like Imps of Sathan, they clamour with their yelling noise, or like Hounds after a poor distressed Hare, saying, he shall come down with a vengeance if he submit not to their bloody wills; so presently the Officer is commanded to let him fall suddenly, and stop ere he arrive at the bottome which piece of horrid Cruelty is not to be imagined by any, the torture is unexpressible, for by reason hereof all the parts of his body are out of frame,

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170272:75"/>neither pen nor spirit, to write the least part of their hellish Cruelties, much less the great and horrid Villanies done to the faithfull servants of the Lord Jesus: They now fall a rayling, calling him <hi>Dogg</hi> and <hi>Heretick,</hi> and that his end will be no other then the same or worse torments: but this is the comfort of all Gods Saints, that the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their minds cannot be toucht, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they pierce every part of their body with most exquisite torments.</p>
               <p>Oh! bloody and wretched villains, void of humanity, nay truly devoid of that good nature recorded of beasts: the Doggs have more love and pity, then these blood-suckers, that like horse-leeches, will no doubt one day burst with the blood of poor Protestants: <hi>The bloody and deceitfull man shall not live out half his dayes: Evill shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.</hi> It is against the Laws of Christianity, <hi>in malo cujusquam acquiescere:</hi> or, <hi>Alieno dolore, quâ dolor est satiari,</hi> to take complacency meerly in the sad miseries and sufferings of others.</p>
               <p>Now if this poor soul, in the extremity of his pangs, cry out to the Lord Jesus Christ, for his assisting and comforting spirit, under these cruell torments, wherein he is thus miserably used and slain for his Name and sake; then doe the Fathers of the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like Devils incarnate with hearts full of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Now if we may affirm the tongue to be the interpreter of the heart, then what fiends in humane shape are these Inquisitors, one would think the pitifull condition of poor Christians should thaw their Icie souls, into a dissolving frame of tears, rather then laugh or scorn at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of such unparallel'd impiety: but what more obdurate then Tyranny larded with cruelty: they minde not that terrible place in <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.13. <hi>Who so stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he shall also cry himself and not be heard.</hi> And Ch. 1. v. 28. <hi>Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer.</hi> But lets proceed. If the poor soul in this sad and dolefull condition, desire to be let down, and promise to confess (even what they would have, except to deny Christ:) then though they promise him liberty and ease, yet doe they (poor creatures) farre worse then if they confessed not at all (as shortly shall be declared in some lively examples:) for they seek their ruin and nothing else, and the more they confess, the more they must endure Torments; what kind of barbarous cruelty is this! truly I cannot finde fit words to cloath their impieties in, they seem to make it their trade to torment poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and to devise cruelties to put men to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170272:76"/>the greatest misery. What is it they torture poor souls for? say they, to make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess their Opinions; that they doe, but we must have them (say they) yet further to confess, who they know of the like prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: that they doe too: Well, is not this all? No, we must now Torment them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are such Hereticks, and put us to the trouble, and themselves to the pain of these punishments? Oh! that men would know, that there is a God to punish, and a Hell to torment, such Tormentors of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, nothing but Rack and Pullie, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing and mangling of mens bodies, till there is hardly any breath left in them.</p>
               <p>The poor soul thus tormented for four or five hours together, they then demand of the Executioner, if he be ready with his other Tools of cruelty and torment, only to see if they can put a further fear into this poor foul; he answereth yea, they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but he has not brought them: they then command them to be brought against next day, for say they, we will fetch these villanies out of this fellow, or he shall feel the smart of our power; so they depart, leaving this poor member of Christ, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably distracted and undone in every part of his body; giving him these words for a farewell; <hi>How now sirrah, how like you this fare? have you enough of it or no? well, see you recollect your wits together; and either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to our demands and tell the truth, else ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no other way to the gates of death then these Torments, as the Reward of your perverse spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit:</hi> further saying, <hi>that it's but a flea bite to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170272:77"/>the storm that shall ensue.</hi> Thus these miserable comforters deal with the poor servants of our Lord Jesus, who hears and sees, though he pleases to suffer it, for the triall of their saith and constancie: what can we doe less then take his Cross as our comfort, since he did take away our sinnes for our salvation? Well, the Goaler puts on his cloathes, and carries him back to the loathsome and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortless dungeon, and sometimes he draggs him on the ground, either by arm or legg like a dead carrion, in a lamentable and cruell manner, promising a Chyrurgion, which he never intends.</p>
               <p>Now if they intend him no more to the Rack, then they send for him from prison, where he must pass in sight of the Torment and Tormentor, who stands there like the Devill himself, to affright the poor prisoner, and bring his former Torments to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance: Now being come into the Court, he is sollicited to confess, if he refuse, to prison again with him:
<note place="margin">Oh! hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers in the shape of men.</note> if he declare his minde never so little, then must he to the Rack to make him confess more: Most commonly when they would add more weight to their perswasions, they send for him even when he is not able to stirre with pain and anguish, desiring him to make his confession, not only of his own heresies, but also of others, which he knowes to be of the same minde; which if he still refuse, he is commanded to prepare for the Rack: wherein if he lose his life, let the blame lie at his own door: then doe the Inquisitors repair again to their Dungeon of cruelty, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170272:77"/>take their places on a scaffold as aforesaid. This poor creature, is again stripped of all his cloathes, his hands bound behind him, and tied fast to the Pullie, binding his thighs together with small cords, so also the calves of his leggs, twisting them with a piece of wood, till they are sunk into this poor souls flesh and cannot be seen:
<note place="margin">The very height of Torment and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> which seems to be as great and terrible a torment as the Devill himself could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise: in this sad condition lies this poor creature for two or three hours, enough to melt a Rock, and turn it into water, and yet such is their obdurate hearts, that they can not only abide to see this Cruelty (a crime to think on it without tears) but they so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit him to confess, and yet is this soul thus sadly afflicted for what he last confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; nay they mock and deride him in this mournfull condition, if these be not Devils under the name of Holy Inquisitors there's none in Hell: Thus doe they with <hi>Nero,</hi> rip up the bowels of all humanity, and rake in Hell for tortures, great enough to screw up poor souls to the height of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery; they see the Devill with the gage of their souls, to undoe others: these are they of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes, <hi>Whose teeth are swords to devour the poor of the earth, and the needy from amongst men:</hi> thus are they forged into the shape of impiety, by the scarlet sins of shameless iniquity: The Lord in his due time, free his people from this thraldome, wherein they are plunged by the cruelty of ungodly and reasonable men.</p>
               <p>The poor soul thus miserably handled,

I say they are not content with what they have done, but must act another tragicall piece of torment, which is with Water; a sad thing I confess, and it may be will move the tender-hearted Protestants to weep at the perusall; yet good Reader, think it not amiss to know them, for these are the Hinges on which their power hangs, wherein their lives and fortunes are closely enshrined, and although men cannot pierce this Hedg-hog of Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Impiety and Cruelty, crept into the midst of a sweet soyl, yet the Arrow of the Almighty will stick fast in it, like a Dart shot into the Liver, like a Hook into the Nostrils of this roaring Leviathan.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170272:79"/>to entangle him in the fetters of his own mistakes; which are so damnably layd, that if he grant one, he must grant others, and deny the contrary; they devise on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such things, as if granted, bring as in a link or chain, a whole train of deductions, sutable to their damnable intentions; so as all torments will not in sum, produce the effects of their desire, so soon as this hellish and devilish way will do; which if the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner answer unto, he cannot avoid the pit they dig for his fall.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Sivill</hi> a good Christian woman was tormented with the Rack, yet could they not condemn her to the stake, they laboured therefore to get from her only this, <hi>That what she had said, was contrary to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Church of Rome,</hi> which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly she did confess; so they got their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked desires of her by drawing destructive doctrines from so sweet a confession. Her husband was before burned, and died a Martyr. Now if it please the Lord of his infinite grace and mercy, by the aid of his good Spirit, to help these poor souls, not only to resist the fiery darts of Satan, but to undergo the cursed cruelties of this Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that all their tortures and villanies, cannot bend their souls to their bloody wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170272:81"/>that this her Aunt was the same woman, which before we gave thee an account of, that was distracted, and ran to the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to inform against the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> who now was through the grace of God reduced to such a quiet temper and magnanimity of spirit, as she witnessed to the truth of the Gospel with much boldness, enduring great torments, horrible and loathsome impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonments, sealing the testimony with her death.</p>

The Priest demands sundry things about the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> (for this confession is only an abuse of the Ordinance) now if he confess ought worthy their cognizance, he desires him to confess it publickly before a Notary, else is the Absolution unavailable; if he grants it, the Clerk is sent for, (being not farre off;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170272:82"/>if he refuse, (for this confession is not Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular, but Vocall) the Priest repeating aloud, forces the Prisoner to answer him, so as the Devil in the box hears him, and pens all down,
<note place="margin">Unjust and merciless dealing.</note> now they proceed against him by this, or else to new torments, for a further confession: Thus they make use of the Name of Christ for their Diabolicall practises, but the Lord will one day judge the secrets of mens hearts, and reward them according to their iniquities. Oh! how little they strive to imitate that blessed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Justice and judgement is the habitation of thy throne</hi> (saies the Psalmist) <hi>mercy and truth shall go before thy face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was once a Lord of the Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Bishop of <hi>Tarracon,</hi> who used to say, that those Hereticks had engraven the words of our Saviour very firmly in their hearts, <hi>viz. (Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self,)</hi> because they would not betray their brethren, though put to endure extream torments. These wicked fathers of the Inquisition use to jeast with poor Christians, saying, Sure you are not strong in your faith that dare not confess; for in the Primitive times, the Apostles and Martyrs confessed whatever was laid to their charge concerning Christ: and thus they play with, and abuse the poor members of Christ, whose condition they will one day defire to enjoy, and shall not, unless God be very mercifull to their unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and cruell dealings.</p>
               <p>Another device these holy Fathers have, which seemeth a notable one, and as like the devil as themselves: they have as aforesaid
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170272:82"/>many Officers (the very scum and vermin of a Nation, for all manner of villanies, (who like little Dogs start the Hare, but the great ones get him) amongst this number is a certain sort, that on purpose serve the lusts of their Masters, and are like Decoys to draw poor souls into the net of perdition, in this sordid manner following:
<note place="margin">A wicked and cursed policy to betray Christians into the hands of violent death.</note>
               </p>
               <p>When any of Gods poor Saints are suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in one prison, in cometh one of these rascals (even like the devil that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before God against <hi>Job</hi>) and forsooth, there is he imprisoned on the same account with these poor persecuted Saints; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is only set on purpose to betray these poor souls, so that when he enters, and is chained and fed with the bread and water of affliction, as the rest are, he begins with small wedges to make way for greater; and just as an hypocrite, he begins with seeming affection to discourse on the things of God, (not much unlike the Jesuites in <hi>England,</hi> creeping into the affections and hearts of poor people under specious pretences only to deceive, as the generation of Quakers too evidently demonstrate) and because he can give his heart room to swing in all waies of hypocrisie, therefore it is that he seemeth to be most sincere, and thereby attracts the ears and hearts of these poor upright ones, to belieeve his treachery for truth; and herein the devil appears like an Angel of light: Thus are these poor Christians trapt and ensnared by this seeming Saint: Therefore having accomplished the ends for which he came thither, he desires a day of hearing,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170272:83"/>(on purpose to confess what he hath heard) and then and there shall his witness be of as full proof against any of the prisoners, as if a hundred were present: Now what a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is, that these Rogues for a little gain, should endure imprisonment, so loathsom and filthy, for two or three moneths toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that is not enough, for they are no sooner come from one place, but into another, like the devil compassing the earth to and fro to accuse Gods Saints: Nay and that which seemeth beyond belief, this limb of hell declareth on Oath,
<note place="margin">The height of injustice.</note> what their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was concerning such and such a Point (which he named) even by their looks, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though these poor souls spake not one word <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con:</hi> Nay further, it often happens, that some which are not imprisoned for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, yet are in the same prison, these to work out their own ends, most basely accuse the servants of Christ, declaring what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course they heard from their mouth; which argues a sad condition, that the liberty of their consciences is a snare for their lives.</p>
               <p>This is not all the wicked practices they use to betray under trust,
<note place="margin">Vile trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son under trust.</note> but you shall have some that associate themselves with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in their private assemblies, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing under the name of <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and indeed are by the common people, and those that know not the design, thought really to be no less then they profess: Many of these are no less then holy Fathers, Priests and Monks; so that if any poor Christian open, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som to any of these devilish hypocrites, they presently send him to the Lords Inquisitors,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170272:83"/>where they are handled as aforesaid. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they disclose not their treachery, upon the fathoming and sounding the principles and practises of such innocent Lambs of Christ, as they betray into the hands of these Wolves, but will conceal their thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a narrower compass then publick discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; desiring a further occasion of conference next day, which is only to have a more full and ample testimony against this poor soul. Again when they have found out and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned any Teacher or Pastor to the private Assemblies of Gods people (some learned Doctor or Preacher) they then make a brute to be spread, that he being on the Rack,
<note place="margin">Detestable hypocrisie to betray poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</note> had detected many sundry of his auditors, and have some ready suborned to swear, that they heard his lamentable and dolorous cries, which was forced from him in the extremity of Torments; now the vulgar being pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, that who so cometh to the Lords In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors, and freely confesseth, shall escape with little or no punishment, else if they be summoned according to the confession of him that is their reputed Doctor, they shall receive no less punishment then tortures and death: By this means they catch many poor souls into the net of destruction, who too readily believe their fallisies for truths. These are the execrable and impious deceits of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men against the poor people of God, whose comfort it is that their souls are in the Lords hand, though their bodies subject to cruelties and miseries.</p>

But although this poor man proved courteous and paid for it, yet was his predecessor cruell and base beyond expression, and rather then punished com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, nay rewarded.

Oh! cursed men, no cruell tyrants in the world would hinder such harmless mirth, but they would have mens souls damned as well as their bodies, it holds comparison with that cursed villain an <hi>Italian,</hi> who taking

               <p>This is the sad condition of Gods Saints, such is their sad dealing from these savage beasts in the shape of men, that such as are not condemned to death, hardly escape it, through this unheard of cruelty in prison; else live so miserable a life, that by degrees, they piue and consume away through the loathsomness of the prisons, and manner of ill diet; this example will too sadly evidence the proof hereof, which may stand as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralel'ld piece of barbarism to all ages.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A Turk frighted from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity by their cruell inhamanity</note> which had revolted from their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and newly arrived from <hi>Marrock,</hi> the principall City of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> lying oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to that part of <hi>Spain;</hi> but being untaught in the Christian faith he was by converse in this City discouraged to be of that Religion, which he saw so evidently deserved all good mens detestation, but thinking safety to be his guard, he one day said, the Moorish Religion was better then the Christians, for which he is put into the Inquisition, where I leave him and you, to imagine his mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable usage, yet boldly said, that he never repented of his Christianity, till he came among their Tygar-like cruelties, which it grieved him to see.</p>
               <p>Another way they have to deceive the world under the name of sanctity,
<note place="margin">They have daies of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation of the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and pity is shrowded great cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>elty.</note> but indeed is only to dissemble their villany; for they order once a moneth a day of Visitation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the cause to be, that Keepers should know they are looked to, whereby they dare not, in regard of a watchfull eye over them, oppress or wrong any prisoner: This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a thing commanded by God, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by men, and no less agreeable to the Law of Nature and reason: But to pervert this only into a shadow and shew of reality, is only like the picture of justice, but wants the power; for these daies, which they say
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170272:89"/>are appointed for holy ends and purposes, and also to stop cruelties from being exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on the poor prisoners, they in stead pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice horrible hypocrisie, for we shall see this day as bad a day of torture, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther season, whereby though they would have their spirituall Court to be sprinkled with holiness above all the justice of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Courts, yet are their cursed hearts more cruell under this vizard of Justice; for on the Sabbath day or some festivall, they come about to visit these poor afflicted and distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed souls, desiring with seeming sense and affection to know how they are, and how their Keeper entreats them, whether civilly or not, either with bad words, threats, or reproachfull gestures; if their full allowance of diet come duly to their necessities, if clean shifts, <hi>&amp;c</hi> These are only words and no more, for if the prisoner be half naked, and pray his condition to be considered and his grievances redressed, what's their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer? Oh! I am ashamed to rehearse their infamous carriage, so much void of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, as to distinguish them from beasts; nay so farre beyond the beastiallity of rude and boisterous creatures without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that beasts most barbarous in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, are truly more void of cruelty then these holy Fathers: What can their Answer be? Ile assure thee good Reader, thou canst not imagine it; but however let us know it, to beware and detest such inhumane cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: In summe, they deridingly Answer these poor naked souls in milde and fatherly terms, <hi>That the bot season requires fewer gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170272:90"/>then they seem to request, that in such a hot climate and time, cloathes are a burden;</hi> and so leave them worse then they found them: If in Winter they desire their wants to be supplied, according to their miserable estate (which <hi>Turks</hi> would pity in their sla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This will be a sad peal at the later day.</p>
               <p>If the poor prisoners desire any books, to recreate their weary mindes, toyled with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull thoughts, and pensive apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or if they desire any other necessaries, that may adde a little comfort to their sad recluse, the like jearing answer is the best return they can get from these Masters of cruelties: If they be very carnest and solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous in any request, they had better be content with their too rigid and sad fate, then plead their just request, to such unjust and bloody men: Thus do these Tyrants make their innocency the Butt of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and cruelty, making a pastime of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; like the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours that used
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170272:90"/>to cast Christians alive to be devoured of wild beasts: But this is worse, for if I were to be cast into such a condition, I could not expect to hope formercy, when I doe but look on the countenance of wild crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but when I look on the face of a man, I may have hope that since he is a rationall soul, he may make so much use of it, as to create a little hope of relief or pity, in the midst of Torments and Cruelties. But here we finde these Inquisitors worse than that poor Lion, who had compassion on a poor slave thrown to be devoured, and did not only preserve his life from his own fury, did not only starve his own hunger, but sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the life of the poor man from the rage of other beasts, there ready to destroy him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding his own life to save his.</p>

<note place="margin">The strange way of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king bribes by the Lords In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors themselves.</note> to raise friends who step so farr into danger, as to intercede in their behalf, it's very dangerous, and not effected without a bribe; and that not facile neither; being done after a strange manner of deceit; for although the under officers, will (as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly as you can imagin) refuse with one hand, and receive with the other, yet the Lords Inquisitors themselves, account it a happy thing to have it, but unhappy to have it known; like the Woodcock, that hiding his head thinks himself secure, because as he sees none himself, so doth wisely think that none see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The morning by break of day, all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers wait on their charge, preparing for the safe conduct of these prisoners of the Lord Jesus, and attiring them in their robes of dishonour and infamy, to render their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and opinions more odious to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people. Those as stand stedfast in the faith, with detestation of such Idolaters and worshipers of Idols for their God, they must wear the Sambenit, even to the stake, being a Vestment made of linnen, coloured all over, pictured with black devils; his head is covered with a long crown'd hat, where is drawn the image of a man burning in the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170272:93"/>fire, with many devils about him, feeding the fire with wood and fagots; all after an ugly manner, and only to render this poor soul reproachfull to the vulgar: Their tongues are pinched, that they cannot speak a word against their slanderous accusations before the people, whereby they are disabled to divulge their innocency, or their doctrine; their hands tied fast behinde, with cords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their necks. Thus come the Martyrs of the Lord Jesus, wearing the badge of their enemies cruelty, yet for Christs sake ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the glorious Crown of Liberty to their immortall souls: Now those as revolt in hopes of life must die the same death, only with this difference, in stead of pictures of devils is the Cross.</p>
               <p>Next come those that are to suffer for the Name of Christ also, but at an easier rate then death, yet arrayed with the like garments of Devils. Now before they set forward from the prison, the Lords Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitours (to blind the world and adde to the weight of their own damnation, if Gods mercy prevent it not) seem before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people to be very sad and heavy at such miserable objects of pity: now all being attired as aforesaid, and placed in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, suddenly they are commanded to stand, and take part of a rich table with provisions for breakfall; only to make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, such was their common fare: Oh! gilded Sepulchres, and painted ruine: for if these poor Saints of God had an appetite, yet are they deceived, for the familiars, with as much impiety as insolency, like dogges,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170272:93"/>snatch away the meat in a rude and beastly manner, yet no check from their Lords; so little impression doe their sad conditions take in the hearts of these cruell villains and limbs of the Devil; that as <hi>Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Cynick,</hi> when he found a Mouse in his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell, said, he was not so poor, but that some were glad of his leavings; so they are not so poorly furnished for heaven, but that they can go without such props of gluttony, and expect a richer table furnished in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for their better entertainment and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, from their world of sorrows, hoping to be put beyond hope, in that eternall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance provided for their company.</p>

               <p>This railing invective, instead of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon being ended, the sentences are read in order as the prisoners advanced, beginning with the least punishments first, which for brevity sake cannot have any grain of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to pass currant in this place, but in the examples of the particular sufferings of Gods Saints, shall in order be ranked among their glorious acts of piety and mercy.</p>
               <p>After these Sentences, the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners for Inquisition sing some short prayer for those that through Apostatizing from the truth have the name of converts, yet must die also: The purport of this prayer is, <hi>That the Lord would vouchsafe strength in this day of triall, whereby they may
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170272:96"/>proceed in the faith of</hi> Rome <hi>to their death; then it sung</hi> Miserere mei Deus, <hi>the</hi> 51 <hi>Psalm: begging mercy for them, and that absolution may be in Heaven fer them, according to the tenour given by the Priests here on earth:</hi> Thus are they sentenced to death without mercy, or whipped with extremity, whereby usually this last proves the worst death: as also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to the Gally and forfeiture of Estates; this is the mercy the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> extends to converts, and those that repent of the true Religion to embrace the Doctrine of Devils; and in my judgment is a clear demonstration of Providence, that no soul may be encouraged in hope of life to deny their Lord and Saviour that purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all those that believe with his dear and precious blood.</p>
               <p>This ended,
<note place="margin">All people present are forced to take an Oath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God and his people, by swearing to support this bloody brat of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid cruelty.</note> the Lords Inquisitors sing some versicles, who are answered by the whole quier in a loud and strained voice: then the Inquisitor pronounces absolution to all such as are revolted from the faith to the Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet not absolving <hi>à poenâ,</hi> but <hi>à culpâ tantum,</hi> and so endure the punishment without equity, mercy or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
               <p>Now one device more these Holy Fathers have, which seemeth strange, yet politick: all the people thronged together at this sight, must there publikely make a solemn Oath, in the presence of God, <hi>To live and die in obedience to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>defending it with hazard of life and goods:</hi> and as if this were not enough, they must <hi>forswear and curse whatsorver is contrary to the Articles of

               <p>Now it falls out, that if any of these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volters from the cause of God (poor souls they are to be pitied, that such a transitory life as this poor world affords, should tempt them to forsake the sweet wayes of our Lord Jesus, and embrace the horrour of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not to be appeased without the tender mercies of the Lord: These are the saddest souls I can espie amongst all these sufferers, it pitties me to relate so sad a story) but I say, poor hearts, if it happen that any of them have been in any Priests orders, they must now undergo the act of degradation, which the Bishop that administred, arrayed in his Holy Robes, in sight of all the people, most strangely, barbarously, inhumanely and tragically performes, even to the pity and compassion, as well as admiration and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of all good and sober Christians. In order to this wonderfull Cruelty,
<note place="margin">The act of degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with great cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</note> the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is dressed in the Holy Apparell wherewith he used to give the Mass, then is dispoyled of them again, using words of conjuration to every particle of this ornament, directly opposite to the words used at the putting them on, when he first received those Holy Orders. Next in order to this, they have a piece of broken glass or sharp knife, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they cruelly scrape his hands, lips, and the crown of his head; denoting the taking off that Holy Oyl wherewith at his initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was anointed; At which sad spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle some cannot but pity him, yet others curse him worse than Pagan or Devill, every one judging as their fancie leads them: those that are not condemned to death, are
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170272:98"/>degraded only <hi>verbaliter</hi> (as they phrase it) But this is some comfort, that they goe not to their graves altogether without remorse of conscience for their sad apostacie.</p>
               <p>Now leave we this sad and dolefull soul, and view another of their last parts of dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, those that are thus as aforesaid termed penitent, are nevertheless mistrusted as if only in hopes of life; therefore they deliver him up to the secular power, with their humble request to use him courteously, without breaking any of his limbs, and yet all are already broken and the poor soul condemned to the fire: Nay if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates should let him escape, or else should not be burned according to their sentence given, they must supply his place, whose cause it was that he did not suffer: yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblingly desire the Magistrates to deal with him in mercy.
<note place="margin">The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants by the Cruelty of Papists.</note> These poor creatures many of them have been brought to the scaffold with hardly a joynt whole, with never a whole bone in their bodies; nay by cruell torments they have their guts, veins and sinewes so disordered, that many have there died in their hands: A man would hardly beleeve this piece of hypocriticall Impudence, that this poor wretch should be delivered to the secular Magistrate, with prayers and intreaties by the Lords Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors, that neither bones should be broken in leggs, arms, or any members of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and when they are delivered into their hands all are already broken, and the poor creature condemned to the fire: these are the wolves in sheeps cloathing, who with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170272:98"/>the Peach, sheweth a rugged heart of stone under a smooth and soft coat: would one believe the Nobles and Magistrates of the Kingdome, should cloud this fallacie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit with silence.</p>
               <p>Now the temporall Magistrate,
<note place="margin">The poor souls half dead with Torments, are led to the stake burned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, or killed first and then burned.</note> according to the desire of the Holy Fathers of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, receive into their custody the Prisoners, carrying them to the place of execution, with Jesuits pressing them hard to forsake their Religion: Now as a device of this Devillish Court, it is so ordered, that if any constantly persevere in the truth, and protest against their worshipping of Idols in stead of the living God, they often with a device on a suddain, break their neck against the stake, and bruit abroad that he died in the Catholick faith; and thereupon the common people believe what they say, which is, that he felt no force of the fire, because he had turned to the truth of the Romish Religion.</p>
               <p>Now those that are to be otherwise pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished then with death, are returned to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, then next day whipped unmercifully, others sent to be Gally-slaves, and the rest committed to perpetuall imprisonment, with strict charge to reveal what shall come to their mindes concerning hereticks, or at their perill; but especially that they never reveal any secrets of their Holy House, either of their useage one way or other; so that death would certainly be as welcome as this loathsome and cruel prison, and death is no less the assured wages which these poor souls must have for their disobedience: This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170272:99"/>guilt, that their Tyranny and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion should not come to the ears of the world: Now in this perpetuall imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are visited as before to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, only to keep them in fear; and to finde how they resent their punishment; if they finde him faulty in revealing any secrets, or what they please to call crimes, he is then punished as they please.</p>
               <p>Many men of good reputation in <hi>Spain</hi> yet in prison, can have none allowed to speak with them, no nor shall they have the liberty to write, unless they peruse and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thereof; and all for fear least their allies and friends know of it, and so complain to his Majesty, who might haply know and then detest their abominations, and knavish Cruelty, bringing the Inquisition on their own heads; for indeed if the King and Court saw this Mistery of Iniquity unvail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I should admire how they could permit such a viper to grow in the Nation.</p>
               <p>Thus continuing in Prison two or three years, they now bring forth whom they please, and begin their old trade as at first; telling them, fresh Information is come in against them on evident proof, threatning the Rack and so to prison again; if that will not doe, they fall to flattery, promising a release, and that not without a rehearsall of this as a great favour: and if any have a release, they have ghosts to smell their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour wherever they goe, so as it soemeth only a liberty in order to future slavery.</p>
               <p>To close up all, As there are divers Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, so is the manner as various; those
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170272:99"/>that are condemned to the fire to be burned alive, are termed Obstinate; and they are such as continue very resolutely: in the truth of God and faith of the Gospel; and some of these are strangled as aforesaid at the stake ere the fire be kindled, and then noised that they died in the faith of <hi>Rome:</hi> Some that through frailty of the flesh and extream Torments, have confessed what they pleased, so seeming to change their belief (yet give good proof of suspicion that all was forced from their mouth, and not freely from the heart,) these are first to be strangled, and then burned. Yet of the same sort, some are to carry Tapers unlighted in their hands, with the Sambenite, and Ropes about their necks, all which are signs not only of guilt, but reconciliation; whereby they declare their sorrow, and are thereby purged from the evil of their fermer errours, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the bosom of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and these vestments of dishonour must be worn during life, for some space or term of years, or else to perpetuall impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, or reclused in some Monastery: yet many that are so sentenced to perpetuall imprisonment, get liberty in less time, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they can make friends to the King: and in a word, what ever the Sentence be, yet is all so left to the Inquisitors themselves, that what their pleasure is, must be. These poor prisoners thus condemned, are often redeemed with a good purchase; for there are young Gentlemen about the King at Court, that for their good services, and at their requests, are Pardons granted to sundry,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170272:100"/>which these young Gallants make merchant dize of, as their Holy Father the Pope does of his Bulls: for they speedily enquire out their Prisoners quality and judgment, and so accordingly contract at such a price as they can agree, selling the Kings Pardons at a dear rate, and yet cannot this be done without consent and notice given to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors.</p>
               <p>Those which have sentence given of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment during pleasure, often plead and petition for liberty, but are put off with dilatory and cunning answers, referring the matter so one to another, that at last there is no hope, unless he can neatly slip a Bribe into some of the Officers hands; which once done, his lipps are unlockt, his heart is open to plead according to the large bounty his hand has felt, more then any fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling of Christian bondage; now his Tongue being tipt with Silver, he begins to prattle and plead for his Client, and if this course be not taken, and that in a larg man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, there is no hopes of Liberty.</p>
               <p>Now the Chief Inquisitors no sooner hear this Brother of this Holy Order prate in pleading, but he knows how squares goe, nay and they understand his meaning by his gapeing, and the form of words he uses; however this poor Client is glad of Liberty, though the loss of his Estate has dearly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased it. The customary pleadings in this Case, are usually as followes; <hi>My very good Lords, my humble suit to your good Lordships is, that this Prisoner may receive favour, of whose good life and conversation, together, with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170272:100"/>his patience in prison, I am fully informed of; therefore intreat your Lordships pleasure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his release:</hi> And this manner of purchase is so dear, as many times it's val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at half their Estates, sometimes all, so that it alwayes provs a dearer purchase to the Protestants in <hi>Spaine,</hi> for the liberty of their bodies,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Papists in</hi> England, <hi>and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants in</hi> Spain.</note> then it doth the Catholicks in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for both body and conscience. A Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick in <hi>England,</hi> known to be so, payes but a part of his Estate, which part is of less value then the liberty of conscience: but in <hi>Spain,</hi> the poor Protestant, if but suspected, is tortured beyond Christianity, nay all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity: and if it can be proved that he is in the least rainted in his judgment, he must certainly lose both Life and Estate.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170272:101"/>Greater Liberty then they enjoy can they not desire; and I am sorry they are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science tyed to such bloody Tenets, as to think it pardonable or meretorious, to kill, destroy, break covenant, what not, to such as they call Hereticks: I am sorry I say, that some of this Religion (otherwise inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous) yet in this, subject their Reason to their unsound judgments; this is that which makes them utterly uncapable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, or sufferance in a well constituted Government; were this the judgment of the I rotestants in <hi>Spain, France,</hi> &amp;c. I would be the first with my vote for an Exile and banishment, where their rebellious judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be lost in a non-imployment, they should not have sooting in any place where Civil Government bears sway; <hi>Terra Incognita,</hi> should be their portions, and wild beasts and barbarians their companions: This is that which breakes society and friendly communion; for when men are bound in conscience to doe mischief, what place they are fit to live in, I know not. What would we account of that man, that should hug a Snake in his bosome, which he knowes will certainly sting him to death? Or what would be thought of that man, that hires servants into his family, which he knowes are bound to kill him if they can?

Shall any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates be more forward to suppress good, then we to supplant evil? Shall the Pope or King of <hi>Spain,</hi> be more forward to erect the <hi>Babell</hi> of Confusion, then we the Gospel of truth? Are not, I say, their judgements of such a generall and powerfull influence, as to prove like worms in children, that devour the place of their birth, and at last them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to; like envy, that together with the loss of its enemies, runs the hazard of his own life, and cares not for the later so he may accomplish the former. But really I hope and wish better from those in <hi>England,</hi> who if touched with the least part of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious temper, will no doubt on serious deliberation, be thankfull to God for such a mercy as the liberty of their consciences; a thing as heartily desired in <hi>Spain</hi> for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, and certainly performed here for Catholicks.</p>

               <p>We shall now proceed in order to the Conclusion, only let the world a little taste of their practices on particulrr persons in a few examples, not only the better to enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven our History, but to shew that as the Theory of this mystery of iniquity has in part been discovered, so also may the Pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctick part to the wonder of after ages, and to stirre up this, not only to detest, but if possible,

What soul can reade and not abhorre these sad and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel'd murthering cruelties? and if God had not declared himself long suffering, and slow to anger, I should here in admiration wonder that his patience should pass by these villains; these are Vultures that seize on men, endeavouring to destroy the likeness of God, which he hath (as the Psalmist saies) <hi>wonderfully made.</hi> This great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of horrid impiety, and monstrous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, fulfils the old adage and turns it into a truth, <hi>Homo homini Lupus,</hi> one man is a Wolf to another: But we all know that no brute beasts will prey upon its similitude; the Lion will not prey upon the Lion, nor the Bear tyrannize over its fellow; yet Man the noblest creature that God hath made, and indued also with reason, that great stamp of destruction, that any soul should destroy that standard of the Lord, it bodes nothing less, then the wrath of an eternall God; but let us not wonder at this piece of savage cruelty, What will not malice do, seeing it's the daughter of pride, and the naturall parent of blood and slaughters?

<note place="margin">Great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for a small fault.</note> as also of an Edict upon pain of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all such as knew any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Sect, either of themselves or others, should not only free themselves by this voluntary confession, but should be well reputed of by the Lords Inquisitors; this poor man speedily repairs to the Office, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints them, that being once at <hi>Geneva,</hi> he heard a disputation about Justification by faith in Christ, which he thought plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him, yet since that time he thought not any more thereof, but was stedfast in the Romish faith, and so he came to crave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for this mighty fault: Now for this only he is imprisoned three moneths, and to wear the Sambenite. Like that Knight of <hi>Rome,</hi> that for translating a Dream into words, was put to death: So this poor man had better suppress his thoughts, and taught another thought to have killed this, then to have thrown it out of his breast, by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of his tongue, and thereby prostrate his conscience, to the mercy of such cruell men: but alas how many are so frighted to condemn their thoughts, by a publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, as if their thoughts were perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, or as if they meant to make them their ghostly Fathers; but their Torments to some are warning enough to others.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170272:110"/>requests are Laws, and to have refused this request, had been to beg his own death; if he had not pluckt his Tree up by the roots, they would pluck him up root and branch. If the Lords Inquisitors desire thy riches or estate, woe be to thee, thy Land and Goods will undoe thee: as it's reported of <hi>Q Aurelius</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Syllaes</hi> time, who stood neuter in the times of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, but yet lamented the great devasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and spoil of his poor Country, and coming to the marker-place, heheard his Name read amongst others that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to death: he presently cried out; <hi>Oh! unfortunate man that I am, my house at</hi> Alba <hi>is the cause of my death;</hi> and presently was openly slain.</p>

               <p>A young Student having Verses found in his book, contrived, as they sounded to the praise or dispraise of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> was therefore imprisoned two years, brought on the scaffold with hose and doublet, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and Taper in his hand, and banished

               <p>At a publick day of Triumph,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The blessed Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> John Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio de Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>of a Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in</hi> Spain.</note> was brought forth on the Scaffold one <hi>John Pontio de Leon,</hi> sonne to <hi>Rhodcrico Pontio de Leon,</hi> Earl of <hi>Balen,</hi> of a Noble Family of <hi>Spaine,</hi> he was a very godly Christian, and endowed with Learning and knowledge of the Truth, and for many years had continued the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession thereof, in a holy and godly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation: To poor needy Christians he was more then ordinarily charitable, the bowels of compassion moved him to the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausting of a good Estate, for which he was
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170272:111"/>(by those that loved not his person, nor charitable example) branded with prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality. But we know, that envy like a dark shadow, alwayes waites on a shining merit. For being taken notice of to be without Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie (the bane of this formall Age,) it was therefore accounted in him a singular vertue, and accounted otherwise only from emulation: These (besides many other graces which God had given him) was he enriched withall; This, sayes my Author, was known to himself and many others to be true, which he attests to be so in the presence of the Lord.</p>
               <p>This poor heart was for his profession of the Gospel imprisoned, and after cruell and barbarous Tortures, and racking for the space of three moneths, was through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity thereof, with enticing words of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, perswaded to embrace their enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for truth; thus through the frailty of the flesh, he shrunk and retired, by reason of their strong assaults and devillish Cruelty; whereas before he seemed invincible, not unfitly to be compared to blessed <hi>Peter, Ile die with thee before I deny thee,</hi> yet before the Cock crew thrice, who knowes not how often he denied his Lord and Master? and as <hi>Peter,</hi> so shall we see this holy servant of Christ, shew a testimony to his truth and integrity of his heart, both sealed with his best blood. Thus we see how the Lord will not leave nor forsake quite, it's but for a time, and then shall his presence be renewed with more strength and comfort; and thus did the Lord shew power in weakness: for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170272:112"/>the very night before execution, when a Confessour approached, he refused his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<note place="margin">A blessed Confession sealed with his blood with great constancy and zeal.</note> with a godly reproof and rebuke.</p>
               <p>Next day Sentence was pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; and first for that he abhorred from his soul the sinfull Idolatry in adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bread; but principally he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the Merits of Jesus Christ were the only way of Salvation, and for the Popes Indulgencies and Pardons, they were only Parchment and Lead, and he himself the very Antichrist, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for my self sayes he, <hi>I value this life and the things thereof at so low a rate, that if God please to call me to it, I have a life to testifie the true undervalue of these mortall enjoyments; praying to the Lord Jesus for my dear Wife and Children, that they may continue in the same belief, to the loss of all they have in this world, and life withall.</hi> Thus with <hi>Moses, he chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of sinne for a season.</hi> This holy servant of God they brand with an Infamous Apostacie to his death, and yet contradict their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in their Records, which runs thus: <hi>John Pontio de Leon, was burned as an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nath Lutheran Heretick.</hi> This was the godly end of this faithfull servant of Jesus, who after he had endured the Cross, and despised the shame,

                  </note> sate down at the right hand of God in Heaven.</p>
               <p>At the same time of Triumph and Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, was brought on the Scaffold a godly soul, by Name <hi>John Gonsalue,</hi> who formerly had been a Popish Priest, but now a servant of the Lord Jesus, and a faithfull sufferer for
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170272:112"/>his Name; who in time of his ignorance preached up the trash and trumpery of the <hi>Pope:</hi> But now the Lord in his mercy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving opened his eyes, he preached the Faith of Christ, crying up the merits of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour above all our own, being justified freely by his grace: His Confession was much to the purpose of his dear acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and fellow sufferer <hi>John Pontio de Leon.</hi> To him the Priests resort the night before he suffered, but he refisted their strong temptations, with shame to themselves and comfort to his own soul, He now departs to the Scaffold with two of his own Sisters going thither to suffer also: he left in prison two of his Brethren and his Mother, one of which Brethren and Mother suffered death the next day of triall and triumph.</p>
               <p>He publikely shews himself stedfast, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and chearfull, for the very first step he made out of the Castle gate, perceiving himself in view of all the people, he speaks with a loud voice unto them from the 106 <hi>Psalm, Praise ye the Lord, O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever: Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord, who can shew forth all his praise? blessed is he that keepeth judgment and doth righteousness at all times,</hi> &amp;c. condemning all Hypocrites as the scum of all wickedness; and thus he was carried to the Scaffold, where being mounted, with an undaunted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, he began to comfort one of his dear Sisters, of whose soft and flexible disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was well acquainted, whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to constancie for the sake of Jesus

Thus died this blessed Martyr, and holy Saint of the most High God, who witnessing a good Confession, sealed it with his blood; to the Lord be

This could not be so secretly done, but was noised in <hi>Spain;</hi> the prevention whereof was as carefully hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as was <hi>Juliano</hi>'s care for dispersing; if as many cart loads of Scorpions or vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous beasts, had been noised to come to <hi>Spaine,</hi> or an army of Devils, more care could not have been taken for prevention; for all Ports were beset with strict watch, lest the light should creep in any way, all this while harbouring the diabolicall Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors: Yet was the goodness of God such to this undertaking of <hi>Juliano,</hi> that they were not only landed in <hi>Spaine,</hi> but in the City of <hi>Sivill,</hi> notwithstanding <hi>Argus</hi> had not more eyes then Searchers had to seize on this Holy Burden: it was not long after, that one of a fearfull and foolish disposition, discovered their landing, but afterwards a false brother, covering his malice with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie and pretence of Religion, did betray the whole Assembly into the hands of their grand Enemies the Inquisitors: they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the scent hard; found them out; which they had no sooner done, but they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of their number at first: but as it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that finding the knot of <hi>Gordius</hi> King of <hi>Phrygia</hi> too dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170272:117"/>this resolute soul, putting a Barnacle on his Tongue, and so is hurried away to the place of execution. Now could he not speak with his Tongue, yet his countenance and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture (the index of his minde) expressed somewhat he would have said: The step whereon he stood, he kissed, and much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged those that were to suffer: He was much solicited to recant by one <hi>D.

<note place="margin">Great cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty in stead of pity.</note> the fleam from his stomack did rope from his mouth in a pitifull manner to the ground: sentence being pronounced, he witnessed a good confession, in a sober and Christian Majesty beyond expectation; a Monk of the same Cloister was ordered to tempt him to Recant; but the more they tried, the more they found his resolutions permanent, even to the death: They put him to death in a cruell manner according to their merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less dealing with him in his life. Thus did this sweet Christian soul triumph over their baseness, by a quiet submission to Gods will, in a patient suffering for his Name; who now as a sufficient proof of his godly life, wrote it in a holy death for his sake, and is now crowned with glory and immortality.</p>
               <p>At this time also suffers a sweet Virgin,

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170272:123"/>poor <hi>Ruizio</hi> little knowing that <hi>Arias</hi> was chosen by the Lords Inquisitors to bandy against him, and argue the case in defence of the Romish Church; when the day came, <hi>Arias</hi> appears as Disputant against him, which startled <hi>Ruizio</hi> into an amazement, yielding to his Arguments, which he had too readily prepared by treachery and policy. This was the practice of this wavering and inconstant soul; yet was the Lord so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto his sinfull and backsliding heart, that he was the very first of the Monastry of S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Isidore</hi> that preached against those foolish superstitions, in which they were all so deeply plunged: Whole daies and many nights, from two till four, were spent in exhortations to sincerity and truth in the inward man, yet not so expresly in down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right tearms, but at a distance, and under covert; whereby they were wrought upon to the true search of the holy Scriptures; and it pleased the Lord so to bless the Word with the presence of his holy Spirit, that many retired from their old superstitions, to this light of the Lord that shiend round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; these seeds sown by this godly <hi>Arias,</hi> were helped forward to bear fruit and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie to the glory of God, for they sought to be better confirmed in the truth, which God of his mercy afforded unto them, by means of some Teachers, as also godly Books brought from <hi>Geneva;</hi> so that in this Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster few there were but had some taste of the truth, yet carried closely, as it did indeed behove them. They endeavour to set this light on a hill, but with such care as it might
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170272:124"/>not be blown out; for secretly they sent out into divers parts of the Country and City, such as both by private conference, and use of books, did greatly advance their godly desires. Danger daily approaching, fears and doubts growing least some should betray them, least their hopes of liberty should be stifled in the cradle, they bethought of esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping secretly to some City of refuge in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> the manner was thought unsafe, for so many and eminent persons for parts and learning, being also the principall of the fellowship, and of such a famous Monastry, as the territories of <hi>Granata</hi> could not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell: and it was thought almost impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without the speciall aid of God, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the furthermost part of <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> their own fear threatning ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack to their forward desires, yet all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to depart suddenly or expect death as the issue; But God of his mercy so provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for their safety, that twelve might es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape at once, which they ordered by sundry waies to pass, and if God pleased, to meet at <hi>Geneva</hi> in one years time: Thus the Watchman of <hi>Israel,</hi> that neither slumbers nor sleeps, preserved the fruit of this well-conceived seed in its own shell, before it was throughly ripe, so that they could not pluck that which their cruelties so much thirsted after. <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. <hi>ult.

               <p>Those that staied were afterwards,
<note place="margin">Persecution</note> three of them burned, and sundry punishments
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170272:124"/>inflicted on severall others; and to this day it is thought this Cloister has produced year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one or two <hi>Lutherans;</hi> such was the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God to this place of darkness, a great part of which is due to <hi>Arias</hi> his endeavours. Thus did the servants of God choose to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the loss of all things in this life, for the enjoyment of their blessed Saviour Jesus Christ, accounting all things as loss in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of him; they with holy <hi>David,</hi> thought it better to live one day in the Courts of God, then a thousand else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
               <p>But to return to our purpose, let us see this <hi>Arias,</hi> once a coward in Christs cause, now a strong Champion; once inconstant, now fixed; he is often suspected for a <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran,</hi> whereupon is as often summoned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords to answer, which he doth, and yet is discharged:
<note place="margin">His repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</note> But at last amongst others, this good soul must witness to the Truth of that God, that was so exceeding mercifull to all, especially to himself. He now earnestly beseeches God to pardon his former iniquities, and accept of him graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously; he is now deeply drowned in godly sorrow, and sadly sits under the shade of true repentance, till at last the Son of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness breaks into his soul with healing in his wings, whereby poor <hi>Arias</hi> that was timerous and fearfull of the punishment of Inquisitors, now laies before himself the comfort and joy of a stedfast and constant sticking to the truth; so as now he most wonderfully chears himself up in the light of Gods countenance; all torments of the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170272:125"/>Rack so little daunts him, that when he (poor creature) is upon the Rack of misery, and they sitting about him to see and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he boldly (as one not in misery but liberty, like that of the Psalmist, <hi>In the day when I cried thou answered'st me, and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened'st me with strength in my soul.</hi>) He tels them freely his minde; how and what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of judgements they must expect from God, for their cruell dealings to poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents, and to Christs members; that they were not fit to sit in judgement, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially touching matters of Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were not only bold but blind, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing his godly sorrow for the times past, wherein he had wronged his own soul, in offending God, and impugning his truth, which now through Gods grace to the last drop of blood he would be a defender. Thus through many cruell torments, with much strength of minde and impregnable resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he passes till he comes to the Scaffold of their Triumphant cruelties, where arraied in robes of disgrace he ascends, and being reverend and aged with gray hairs, and (no doubt) of much grace also,
<note place="margin">He suffers and boldly confesses his sinnes, and laies down his life for the truth.</note> he leaneth upon a stast, and there not only bewails his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer offences, but witnesseth a blessed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the truth before God and all the world; there out of his humble heart he dropped not only tears of repentance, but also out of his full stored soul, he drops pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious pearls amongst a herd of swinish au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors. Thus departs he from this place, to the place of execution, from the Stage to the Stake, where having triumphed over
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170272:125"/>the stage of humane chances, who having gone under their cruelties with a glorious conquest, with a joyfull and quiet minde, in a sweet and chearfull countenance he had his soul so sweetned with Gods gracious presence, that he was fully fitted for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ere he received his pass-port from the hands of death: Oh! blessed and for ever happy <hi>Arias,</hi> but more blessed thou merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and good God, who art found of those that seek thee not, who seekest those that love thee not, who bid'st us come to thee, and if we will not, thou wilt come to us, whose grace is as liberall and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as the sun that shineth on all: For ever blessed be thy Name for this example of grace and mercy to thy poor servant: This holy servant of the Lord Jesus, that once scorned the Truth, nay that persecuted it against his conscience, that thought it a dishonour to fight for his Name; now hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Arias</hi> accounts it his glory, his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to wear his Masters livery, though wrought with his own blood; Content to let his life prove a sacrifice to their wrath and malice, signing his faith with a seal of constancy, he can now triumph over their cruelties in a joyfull death, not in the least so cowardly vallourous, as to wink at the blow of death, but rather with the blessed Apostle saying, <hi>Oh death where is thy sting! Oh grave where is thy victory!</hi> &amp;c. Truly this is a singular pattern of grace and mercy in the midst of sinne and iniquity: He may stand as a pillar or monument of the riches of free grace, let us give the Lord the only
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170272:126"/>glory. <hi>If ye suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye: If you suffer with him, you shall also raign with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ascends the stage of publike obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, another worthy and blessed Saint of the Lord, who resolving to continue a faithfull servant, proves also a faithfull Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr and sufferer for the Gospel,
<note place="margin">D<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio <hi>a great defender of the Truth to the death, and a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>

                  <hi>Aegidio</hi> steered another course of life, studying to attain to the Truth in Righteousness.</p>
               <p>If I take liberty to digress a little, I shall with the River <hi>Arithuse</hi> appear again; yet I hope it will not be a direct digression from the thing in hand, to let the world know the person who under God was the author of so strange yet blessed change in this great Doctor: and it cannot be thought a derogation from the glory of God, to conceal so great a piece of his power, in such weak means, to so great purposes, as he often proved a good Agent. But least our Preamble, prove a greater digression then the body of the Story, know; that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument in Gods hand, was one <hi>Roderico Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerio,</hi> who was long before condemned at <hi>Sivill</hi> by the Lords of the Inquisition for a
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170272:126"/>false Apostle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which he lived in exile, and there suffered for the Gospel; he was a Citizen of <hi>Nebrissa</hi> in the territories of <hi>Granata;</hi> of a good extraction, being from the line of a good Family; the Estate God lent him, he employed worse then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Donor, exceeding above all young gallants in the City, for all sports, recreations and rich attire, his equals, nay his superiors for estate, could not jump with his excess: suddenly by a strange instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he leaps from the top of all this glory, and descends to a contempt of all worldly vanities, disdaining to be moved at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach which fame fixed on this change: He not only leaves all these as sinfull behind him, but he falls to contemplation on Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things, and from thence to a holy and heavenly conversation; gradually mounting to such a degree of sanctity, that all stood amazed at this blessed-change; every thing of vanity (which before was sealed and fixed in his minde) is now shifted from its station, and put to shift for a living in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother soyl: his soul seemed to allude to that report of Irish wood, whereon no Spider will build, or like the River <hi>Danube,</hi> which will not mix it self with the muddy streams of <hi>Sava:</hi> So this blessed soul starved all his bad thoughts, and stifled their growth in his minde, no acceptance to sinne or iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could be found in him; God changed his heart, gave him a new heart: he had in his younger years got a touch of the Latine tongue, whereby it proved to his advantage of perusing the holy Word of God, which
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170272:127"/>he laboured at day and night, not without Gods blessing in abundant measure (such blessings follow the study of Gods minde and will in his written word:) He often engaged in a warre of disputation with Monks and Priests, which Pharisaicall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration admired how he should a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Wondring at this arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, they called him to account by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his parts? his commission and warrant for his work? by what Authority? who sent him? also after what manner he was called? to which <hi>Valerio</hi> replies; <hi>His knowledge he received from Heaven, through the assistance of Gods holy Spirit, who out of the flood-gates of mercy, did abundantly showre down of his grace into his soul: his boldness was the naturall product and issue of a good cause; that in Christs name and by his authority he did what he did,</hi> &amp;c. He is called before the Inquisitors, where he disputes about the true Church, the Signes and marks of it of Justification by faith in Christ, which, sayes he, the Lord of his grace hath enlightned me to understand. They let him goe, but with the loss of all his Estate, which he thanked God for, who honoured his own Name in such a vile wretch: he is two years after summoned again but he wore the Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benite, and was adjudged to perpetuall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment; only suffered with others to goe to S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Salvators</hi> Church to hear Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, where he often started up and spoke against the Minister, which was excused and passed by, through belief of his folly and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170272:127"/>madness: he was at last removed to a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious House in S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Lucar;</hi> where he ended his daies in the 50<seg rend="sup">th</seg> year of his age; the Sambenite which he wore was of the largest that any wore, and is now hanging in the Vestry of the chief Church in <hi>Sivill,</hi> as a monument of a notorious and speciall He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, with an inseription of Great Letters thus; <hi>Roderico Valerio, a Citizen of Nebrissa, an Apostate, and a false Apostle of Sivill, who said he was sent from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To return to our more immediate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, know, that this was the man that of slight esteem amongst men, found accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for his advice in holy <hi>Aegidio</hi>'s heart: This learned Doctor, to recompence <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi>'s favourable advice, did alwaies stand a friend to him before the Inquisitors, which brought him at last into suspicion. Next unto this advice of <hi>Valerio,</hi> our good Doctor was familiarly acquainted with that holy sufferer and Martyr of Christ <hi>Constantio Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> of whom we shall next treat: he also had acquaintance with others of excellent parts, which together with hard study, reduced all knowledge and sincerity as servants to him; as inseparable companions to his minde, he became hereby exceeding learned, holy and zealous.</p>
               <p>Now the peoples affections flocked in heaps, to the approbation and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Doctors Ministry; as also of holy <hi>Constantino,</hi> with zealous <hi>Varquia Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no:</hi> and as love and affection flowes in on one hand, so does envy (the hand-maid of deserts,) follow at the heels, daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170272:128"/>proceed as the issue of their attractive vertues, whereby hazard accrues to their persons, especially of this Saint: about this time the <hi>Emperour</hi> elected him as a fit man to be Bishop of <hi>Dortois,</hi> but his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that lurched for advantages, stop his progress, and cite him before the Holy House, he is cast into prison; now is he examined concerning the principall heads of Religion, whereby he must of necessity (if he answer,) discover his judgment: He is charged as a favourer of that notable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>Valerio de Nebrissa;</hi> to all which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers and makes a good witness to the truth, but at that time they durst not for sundry reasons take away his life; there did many of quality appear in his behalf for favour; one <hi>Corrano</hi> an Inquisitor, by reason of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, stood his friend: Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by many other occurrents of lesser mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, know; that one <hi>Dominico Asoto,</hi> a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phister of magnitude in the University of <hi>Salamank,</hi> betwixt whom and our Doctor <hi>Aegidio,</hi> was appointed a publick disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but ere they both appeared, they had agreed together upon Articles: to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red publikely before the audience, which was pretended by this <hi>Asoto</hi> to be in favour of his Antagonist: Order is given forth by the Inquisitors to erect two Pulpits in the Cathedrall Church; <hi>Asoto</hi> ascends, preaches a Sermon, which done, immediately he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a Declaration of his own devising, which he sayes are the Articles agreed on betwixt D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                  <hi>Aegidio</hi> and himself; <hi>but was absolutely contrary to Truth, or that which they

<note place="margin">Deceit and Hypocrisie in the highest.</note> he demanded D<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Aegidio</hi> to give publick testimony of assent, either by speech or gesture, which innocent <hi>Aegidio</hi> did denote by confessing all to be true which <hi>Asoto</hi> said, all which was as innocently spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as traiterously interpreted; but he that trusteth in a lye shall perish in truth: now from hence they draw such conclusions as were stretcht beyond the due limits of the premises; yet is he for this condemned to three years imprisonment, not suffered to reade, preach or write for ten years after, nor to depart <hi>Spaine</hi> in that time: all this while <hi>Aegidio</hi> knew not the meaning thereof, till he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170272:129"/>he told them, it was not so, nor did he know of their Monkish dealing, nor should once have suspected it if he had not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived too evident proof of the truth thereof. Whilest this good man endured with great patience as great imprisonment, died three of his grand Adversaries, who as they were eminent in malice to him and against the truth, so also as much for their places; and as my Author sayes, some did not leave this bad world, without horrible expectations of a worse to come. Thus this good soul lived in prison, with as much comfort, and more, then his Adversaries in a larger field of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; he did much good also after the time of three years was expired; being sent on an Embassie, which journey drew on sickness, and therewith his death, enjoying the Lord as the Crown of his hopes, and testimony of his faith in Jesus: Two or three years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they digged up his body, and buried in the same grave, and in his Name, a man of straw, bringing his body to the Scaffold, which they handled as they would have done if he had been on earth: but God that sitteth in Heaven laugheth them to scorn; and no doubt as he hath them in derision, so must they expect a day of confusion, and revelation of the justice of God on such hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and heathenish Cruelties. I'le only end this with putting these Fathers of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition in minde of that of <hi>Ovid,</hi> to shame them to acknowledgment of their savage baseness; for that they cannot either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the living above, nor the dead under ground.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170272:130"/>from extinguishing: A Divinity Lecture is placed in <hi>Sivill,</hi> whereof he is elected Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, wherein to great advantage to all well disposed hearers, he made a large progress, being able enough to undertake the charge, and no less able to discharge his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; yet was under a notion of zeal hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in a future proceed: He was not to be dealt with in Disputations by any there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, as might at large be shewed, but to avoid prolixity: His trouble begins with small wedges, they make way for greater, complaining of his marriage before entrance to his Orders; every one that maligned him, spurred him as hard as they could, to put him out of breath, but he withstood them all, his countenance amongst his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies was a little terrour, his answers were so well wrought, that they could not by any means bring him to an open protestation of his faith, which they covertly labour'd to accomplish; yet at last, rather then deny, he confessed it to the glory of God. But to conclude, passing by the Manner, let us come to the Matter of an unexpected disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, made of all the Books and Papers of this holy Doctor, found in a Religious Matrons house, who had hid them in a wall; we will imagine the Lords Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors glad of this purchase, for who will not think so? there was found a large Volume of his own hand writing, wherein he had given his judgement concerning the true Church, and the Pope called by him the very Antichrist; and so runne through the body of Popery, with a quick dissection and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170272:131"/>judgement; there they saw with what sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity he wrote, and what a clean sense, and full sight he had of Divine things: he would not for a long time confess it to be his, till at last intending to give God the glory of all, he openly acknowledges all things therein contained, not only to be his own writing and doing, but that he was still the same man, and hoped to be so through Gods grace to the last breath; <hi>and so,</hi> saies he, <hi>leave seeking of witnesses to produce against me, and use me as you please:</hi> he continued after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards two years in prison, where by extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of heat, base unworthy diet, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somness of the prison, together with sorrow for the estate of the Church of God, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent a bloody Flux;
<note place="margin">His death.</note> at length yielded up his sweet soul in this filthy and loathsom prison fifteen daies after. They caused it to be bruited abroad, that in his life on the Rack (which he never tasted of through Gods mercy and providence) he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected sundry of his Scholars, and to strike these falsities home to the belief of all men, sundry persons of the next prison were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned to swear, that they heard his sad eccho of cries and shrikes, under that suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torment, all which was only to get such under their lash, by a voluntary confession, in hopes thereby of pardon, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they could prove nothing against: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, this Reverend and Learned Doctor had opprobious songs made of him, and sung by boyes, and on their triumphant day his body was taken out of the grave, and a man of straw in the stead; which

               <p>OH! that we could distill some few Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolaries, from these bitter vegetables of <hi>Spain,</hi> and suck some comfort from the breasts of so sweet consolations as flow from the blessings of sanctified afflictions. What shall we say of these sad sufferings of poor Christians under these cruell Taskmasters, that if it be their pleasure to destroy men, die they must <hi>per fas, aut nefas:</hi> they must be Hereticks.</p>
               <p>These cursed Inquisitors for their horrid dealings and unparalell'd impieties, are to be accounted no other then as Schismaticks from man-kinde; that have only the face of men but the heart of vultures: Oh! that we could tell how to draw forth these mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our brethren, to a right use, that we could bring them home to our own doors by a sweet sympathy: Who knows what his
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170272:132"/>own condition shall be ere he depart this life and be seen no more: The Psalmist sets us a fair copy, <hi>By the rivers of Babylon there we sat down, yea we wept when we remembred Zion.</hi> Sufferings to the people of God are as naturall concomitants in this life, as life it self: The death of the body is the life of the soul; that afflictions in this world, as well as everlasting joyes in another, are the portion and lot of Gods Saints, I think there is none doubts; the chain of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is made of both: And indeed he is a stranger in <hi>Israel</hi> that expects his way to heaven adorned with pleasure: What is it that sweetens mercies so much as afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Who puts so great a value on the riches of grace, as those that receive in their own spirits the deep sense of sin? <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> is a lively instance, <hi>She loved much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause much was forgiven her:</hi> What pleasure is sweeter then that which is purchased with difficulty. <hi>Bread eaten in secret</hi> (saies <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>) <hi>is pleasant:</hi> When is the Gospel of more esteem then when a torrent of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and flood of oppositions stand in the way? Oh, how sweet when snatch't from the jaws of violence! Oh! the blessings of humility, the blessed frame of a contrite spirit, it's then, or never most fit for Divine impressions: It is better to go to the house of mourning, than feasting; afflictions make a man know himself, nay drive him out of himself; make a man as fit for God to work upon, as the fire doth the wax for the impression of the seal. Holy and blessed <hi>Bradford</hi> was in a heavenly posture under
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170272:133"/>the triall of his adversaries cruelty; his soul melted under the deep sense of sinne, which made him use very humble expressions at the subscription of his letters, whereof some were these: <hi>The most miserable, hard-hearted unthankefull sinner, John Bradford:</hi> Again, <hi>A very painted hypocrite, John Bradford.</hi> Dost thou expect to enter in at that narrow gate, and not first through that broad road of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tribulations? To receive the word in much affliction was the portion of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saints in the Apostles time: Christians are most fruitfull under the greatest burthen, like Cypress, the more depressed, the more it grows. It's observed in <hi>Spain</hi> that the valleys are most fertile, and yield increase, when the hils are barren; such (saies one) are the blessings of humility. How sweet was that terrible and blustering voyage of <hi>Paul</hi>'s to <hi>Rome,</hi> whilst the Souldiers and Mariners are in a storm at Sea, and their spirits storm at it with fear and rage, honest and blessed <hi>Paul</hi> he is in a calm, and in a serene Harbour, he sleeps as if he were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to heaven; they are afraid that every blast will blow them over, and every rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wave soop them up, and involve them in eternall misery, when good <hi>Paul</hi> lies and snores in the Cabin of rest, free from either care or trouble. Affliction exerciseth ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue at large, and often proves the touchstone of sincerity, whether true or adulterate: Oh how the presence of the Lord sweetens the sad and pensive hours of poor mortals! And that this is a certainty, experience is the truest proof. And as it is thus with the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170272:133"/>people of God in particular, so let us see how the Church of Christ in generall thrives under restraint, lives in the flames of the hottest persecution: The truth of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted in his Saints, is like seed sowen in good ground, receiving Gods blessing to a vast increase; and very much resembles the Glow-worm, most splendid in obscurity: or as Diamonds sparkle most when the light shines least; like books that are not well bound, till well beat: like Grapes in the Wine-press, the extraction being the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence of so great violence.

                  </gap>or the Church of Christ so? nor may it unfitly hold comparison with perfum'd wax, whose odoriferous fragrancy attracts the sense, also is content to receive any stamp, <hi>yet neither</hi> till burned: or like iron, unfit for any forge or shape, till heat in the fire, and beat on the anvill. This, this is the portion of all Gods Saints: Therefore let us not think it strange when it courts our acceptance; for 'tis our joy and blessedness, if God smile upon us in such frowning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences; if God showr down such mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, through the clouds of mens malice and hatred to the truth, and his people for the truths sake: <hi>He that will live godly in Christ Jesus, must suffer persecution.</hi> Oh the sweet harmony betwixt God and a soul in secresie, and under a recluse! the sweet repose a soul has with Christ in a dungeon of darkness! <hi>They looked unto him and were enlightened, and their faces were not ashamed: This poor man
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170272:134"/>cried and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles: Oh tast and see that the Lord is good, blessed is the man that trusteth in him: Oh fear the Lord ye Saints, for there is no want to them that fear him.</hi> In such seasons of affliction, where can a soul be more freely, nay where any reall welcom but with Christ, and then is the best welcom. It was the lot and portion of our dear Lord Jesus, to suffer ere he entred into glory; and though he was <hi>sine flagitio,</hi> yet not <hi>sine flagello.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the sun shine of prosperity is the road to sinfull adversity; adversity as the product of iniquity; and such a time must (in my judgement) be a sad affliction, wherein God estranges himself, and leaves the soul to the result of his anxious thoughts: 'Tis a great affliction for a soul to be in anguish of spirit, and God forsake him; the sweet sun-shine of Gods savour is clouded in such a pensive estate: A beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prosperity is more dangerous then a stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my adversity: A man will sleep and repose himself in his Cabin, when 'tis fair, but looks about him, rouses himself, and shakes off all sluggishness in a storm; if a storm rises he rises. 'Tis reported of the <hi>Oyster,</hi> that when she is pursued by the <hi>Crab,</hi> her mortall foe, she then claspeth her self with her shell, locks her self in her own house; but when without fear she lieth on the shoar, dallying with delight under the beams of the sun, then the <hi>Crab</hi> taking opportunity by the foretop, puts little stones between the lips of her shell, and so picks out the very heart of the poor <hi>Oyster.</hi> Thus it fareth
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170272:134"/>with poor creatures in this world, their worst daies are their best, though the sun shine not upon them, yet security is their Harbour; daies of affliction prove daies of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the greatest enemies to the Saints, prove (by the blessing of that great Chimist the Almighty Jehovah) their best friends. If we cast anchor here, where our hopes have no being, what will become of us when storms arise? Now truly on serious view, and review of things of this life (both in their true nature and productions) I cannot but wonder why we should be riveted to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitories, why our immortall souls should feed on mortall enjoyments, and seem to relish a happiness where they fall short in their promise? We build upon sand whilst we sport our selves in hopes of any thing of worth here below; sure I am there's little reason in nature, and less in grace to intrude such a belief: For sublunary pleasures are like Epicurean dishes of cost, that arrive not to the value of one eternall thought: Like tough meats, that take more chewing then they yield nourishment: for we see in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous seasons, how ambition thirsts after greatness, to the loss of goodness; embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing only a snake, which suddenly ere he can start back, or recover his ground, seizes on him, from under the violet leaves of his ruin'd hopes: Who is so blinde and cannot see, so hard and cannot melt, at the sight of many professours, how they soar above, when supported with a sudden exaltation; how ready, like tinder, to take fire of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition from the spark of every occasion? if
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170272:135"/>preferment pull them by the cloak, it will be sure to trip up their heels; if outward pleasures and profits look and stare them in the face, they are sure to have their pockets pickt, and emptied of that which is of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worth, than all the Ledgerdemain of worldly attendants; yet, I say, such is the vain crop of many mens expectations, that if the world smile in their faces, and the sun shine of esteem court their acceptance, Oh! how (even professors of the Gospel) pride in this opportunity and with gay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises look big, till the imposthume breaks, till the paint falls off like leaves in <hi>Autumn.</hi> It is my reall trouble and grief to think, that I have observed some shrowd their defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities under the penthouse of a Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: (the bane of too many, though a blessing in it self) and once admitted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn others before above them, as now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them; who as men from a high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, see every one like crows to them, like Pigmies to the stature of their Giant-like deserts; nay which is worse, that which should priviledge men from sin, rather co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers their sin; they dare do that now they durst not before, and if reproved, What (think they) I am a Church-member, and if our variance come to be publick, I am sure to get the better in the esteem of the godly, and let the wicked say what they will: Thus that which the very name of should put men (for shame) on the practice of <hi>fincerity, humility</hi> and true <hi>godliness,</hi> does now serve only as a mantle to profanness: The worst I wish to such, is the same I wish
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170272:135"/>to my self, that God would open their eyes to see the dark path wherein they walk; that God would please to discover the principle of hypocrisie, too much (I fear) rooted in the hearts of professors of this age; the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and humility of the Gospel is thrust too farre off, Religion seems to be an easier task then formerly, less holiness will serve, if we have but the more esteem: Oh! sad daies of defection, that popular glory should make any man hazard his eternall soul; this is sadly to be lamented; but sure I am it was not so in times of persecution: such are the sad effects of prosperity, it putrifies true sanctity; whereas adversity sanctified purifies it, and makes men prove good Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimists to their own souls.</p>
               <p>This villanous and bloody Inquisition has no other shrowd for its Tyranny, but a Religious knavery (as I may so say) all is hid under the robes of sanctity, and shall Christians tread in the same road? shall Gods Saints and servants have less in their hearts, then on their tongues and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances? the later tipt with nimble excuses, the former dead to all activity for God; I would never have a sober look without a sober heart, and serious thoughts: It's but deceit to look one way and think another; and as some men have dark shops, so these have light to put off their dark and bad wares; search the secret retirements and haunts of such professors, and you will finde their Ware houses (their hearts) to be the sinks of all iniquity; alas 'tis but bad po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to think to deceive God, who searches
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170272:136"/>the hearts, and trieth the reins, and as he detests, so will he (according to his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted method) detect such impieties: For there is no greater sin then to cover it with the figge-leaves of piety, 'tis but sin aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated; and he that would know something of the nature of hypocrisie, may (next to his own experience) finde a succinct, yet true discovery of that leaven <hi>(by that great dissecter of hypocrisie, that mirrour of his age, one whose fresh remembrance makes many hearts bleed besides mine, as if by our sins we were guilty of his death)</hi> Mr. <hi>Guthbert Sidenham,</hi> in his small book on that subject. All that I would couch under these lines, is to learn us that prosperity and adversity are different tasks, they have different events; the fairest flower has not the sweetest smell: How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wilde roots have sober operations, when the gay Tulip only serves for ornament. If I would wish a good to my own soul, give me adversity before purblinde prosperity, which latter to look through, is but to turn the wrong end of the prospect, if I would see my self in my native colours, let me look in the glass of adversity; But if God link heaven and prosperity together, 'tis a mercy of a vast dimension; 'tis like a good har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after a sore storm; and he escapes well from danger that gets to heaven over such rough and craggy mountains of oppositions and temptations. Now though all will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this true, yet it's he that writes <hi>as none ever did,</hi> that can storm assent so, as to follow the path which leads to life. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever let me lay this down as an infallible
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170272:136"/>
                  <hi>maxim</hi> in Christianity; That he cannot go so pleasantly to heaven, cannot have such inward refreshments in his soul, that hurls the world like a foot-ball before him, that has the lower Orb at command; as he that loseth all things to gain Christ.</p>
               <p>Now, Courteous Reader, though I strike at others, yet think not that I intend not my self, amongst the multitude of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and vicious: Like Ministers of the Gospel, that whilst they preach and exhort the Congregation, yet do they not exclude themselves from their own Doctrines; and I cannot but reckon it as a great mercy to any one, that humbly thinketh himself the greatest sinner and hypocrite in the world; for whilst he thinks so, 'tis a thousand to one that it ever proves so, if he walk under the deep apprehensions of it.</p>
               <p>I wish we that hear, and do not see, these sad calamities, may distill the sweetness of such a condition, and fetch comfort afarre off, before misery come too nigh hand; and though not drawing it on our heads by forestalling the date of afflictions, yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to use the world as though we used it not; we are dallying in the sun-shine of the Gospel, who knows how suddenly the night of affliction may, like an eclipse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray our hopes? let us prepare for futurity, let's labour to be fitted for all events of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, hanging loose to the world, and grow in holiness, that we may be ready to be gathered into the Garner, as good wheat, when it shall please the Lord to cut the thred of our lives, that whilest others are like chaff
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170272:137"/>before the winde, we may remain refin'd and pure wheat: This I desire and wish may be the fruits of a candid perusall of this book, that holiness may be writ upon the posts of our doors, that the lights of Gods people may so shine before men, as they may glorifie our Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that Gods people may have their souls adorned with the sweet graces of Gods holy Spirit: <hi>Then shall all thy Saints, oh God! bless thee, and all the ends of the earth worship towards thy holy Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have we run through the severall branches of this Piramide of <hi>savage cruelty, blood, inhumanity,</hi> and <hi>cursed tyranny,</hi> enough to estrange the influence of heavenly light, from that soyl, so watered with the blood, and manured with the bodies of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Christians. There were some in the Gospel that told Christ of some <hi>Galileans,</hi> whose blood <hi>Pilate</hi> had mingled with their sacrifices; so may not we say, These bloody Inquisitors, have mingled the blood of Gods Saints with their sacrifices; one soul whereof we may justly affirm to be of more value, than a million of Inquisitors, who for invention of barbarous deaths and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may justly challenge hell it self.</p>
               <p>Thus, Courteous Reader, have I given thee a tast (and but a tast) of their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which indeed are such, as suck their venom from the bowels of vengeance and fury: Thou hast seen a bad Prologue, a sad Interlude, and a Tragicall Epilogue; though indeed on the other side, a blessed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Epilogue, for which the name of the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170272:137"/>great Jehovah be for ever praised. Oh! thou bloody brat of Satan, thou that art the Seminary of all miseries! the storehouse of the wages of iniquity! thou that hast long supported thy self with the blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury of poor Christians! what account wilt thou one day give to the eternall God, for the blood of so many thousand of his dear and faithfull servants? You will experience an eternity wherein you will wish your selves into a <hi>Non entity:</hi> God will no doubt lay the Axe to the root of your cruelties. If he was to be condemned that melted a jewell of great worth in one cup to satisfie his Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean fancy, what then will be your portion, what account will you give at that great and terrible day,
<note place="margin">Jewels of great price.</note> for the millions of Christian blood you have shed? which to recount, would grapple with faith to believe: You that carry as Trophies of Honour, the spoil of Nations and Christians, yet will you one day carry no more with you to your graves, then is said of <hi>Saladine</hi> Emperour of the East, who commanded only a white sheet to be carried before his Corps to the grave, with this Proclamation, <hi>This is all that</hi> Saladine <hi>carrieth to his grave, of all the spoils and riches which he had triumphantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired his many victories withall.</hi> When you come to reap the harvest of your scarlet ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, what increase of woes will cleave to their unparalell'd sins? The Ivy cleaves not closer to the Oak, than, by the rate of just proportion, Gods fiery indignation will pursue your infamous cruelties: When the dawning of that great day appears, where
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170272:138"/>can you hide your selves from the fierceness of Gods anger? Consider this, you that forget God, lest there be none to help you; Oh that you could set a higher rate on eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as not to purchase damnation with so high cruelties and flagitious enormities! You have fether'd your nests in the soft embraces of unrighteous Mammon, but you must with the unjust steward in the Gospel, give an account at the later day; The curse of God is lodged in every corner of your house, which will make you one day trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quake with <hi>Felix,</hi> when you hear of Judgement to come; God will not take a fee, nor can he be bribed from justice; you will then wish your place in hell to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Heathens, and be even ambitious of ordinary damnation in that lake of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Let us all pray that these Caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and Vermin of a Kingdom, that rake in the bowels of innocency and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, that God would please to cut down such tall Cedars, as grow in this wilde forrest of pretended sanctity; and I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it no less then a dwarfing of belief, for any one to think that it shall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
